<h1>Vegetarian Cuisine<br>at Mount Madonna Center</h1>
At Mount Madonna Center, we make an effort to provide delicious and nourishing meals that accommodate our community and guests. All meals are 100% vegetarian and we provide a vegan and gluten-free option at every meal. We use organic ingredients as much as possible. We make an effort to label known allergens. We do not permit guests to bring food from outside.
<p>
Guests are welcome to set aside additional amounts of whatever does work for them, to eat later. There are shelves and refrigerators for this purpose near the Dining Room.
<p>
Reverse osmosis filtered water and tea are available 24/7 in the Community Building, Seminar House, Conference Center, and Orchard House.
<p>
Some people have extreme sensitivity to certain foods such that even the slightest trace amount of such foods can trigger life-threatening allergic reactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that no trace amount of any given food will ever appear in other dishes. Someone with an allergy of such severity should know this in considering whether they want to come to Mount Madonna Center.
