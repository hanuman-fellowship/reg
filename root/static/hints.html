<h3>Helpful Hints for Filling in the Housing Grid</h3>
<ol>
<li>The <b>Name</b> field should <u>only</u> contain names of the people staying in the room.
<li>The <b>Email and Notes</b> field should contain the email address of the person.   If the person truly has no email address put the words 'no email' somewhere in the field.   You can <u>also</u> use this field for whatever other purpose you wish.
<li>In a <b>Name</b> field of the Housing Assignment Grid if you put:
<ul>
    Charles Jones & Mary Smith
</ul>
(names separated by an ampersand '&')
this means that there are two people in the space (usually a tent)
and that they both should be charged the normal cost.
<li>If you put:
<ul>
    Mark Bronson & Aaron child<br>
</ul>
or
<ul>
    Greta Haroldson & Annie child & Bobby child
</ul>
(a name followed by the word 'child')
then the children will be charged half of the normal cost.
Children are defined to be age 12 or under.
<li>If the name is like this:
<ul>
    James Carter (Jimmy)
</ul>
Then the badge will have just the nickname 'Jimmy'.
<li>If you put:
<ul>
    Mark Gibson / Edward Unger
</ul>
(names separated by a slash '/')
this means that Mark and Edward will both occupy the room
sometime during the event but not at the same time.
<li>The above cases will be highlighted <span class=special>in red</span>
when the grid is displayed with costs.
<li>The names of houses with a fixed cost will be shown in <span style="color: green">green</span>.
</ol>
