      Our food service is strictly vegetarian - no meat,
      fish, fowl, or eggs. Please do not bring any outside food.
      With advanced notice, we do our best to accommodate dietary
      restrictions.  If you have serious allergies,
      contact your retreat coordinator and/or the
      Guest Services Office to discuss available options.
      <h2>Getting Here</h2>
      <p>
         Maps, directions, and shuttle listings are available at our <a target=_blank href='https://www.mountmadonna.org/transportation-directions'>Transportations & Directions</a> page. We do not recommend relying on GPS as it sometimes will direct you to roads that are undeveloped and/or impassable.  You may want to print out directions from the link above, as cell service can be unreliable as you travel up the mountain.
      <h2>Cancellations</h2>
For Personal Retreat or Program reservation cancellations received
at least two weeks before your reservation date, you will receive a
full refund to your credit card. For cancellations received from two
weeks to 48 hours prior to the reservation date, you will be charged
a processing fee of $50 and the remainder of your payment will be
held as a credit for you to reserve a future Personal Retreat or
Program within one year. Credits are not transferable to another
person. If you cancel within 48 hours of your reservation date,
if you do not show up, or if you leave early you will not receive
a refund.
      <h2>Maps</h2>
      <p>
         Maps of the <a target=_bank href='https://www.mountmadonna.org/assets/img/Main_Area_Map_MMC.pdf'>Mount Madonna property</a> and <a target=_blank href='https://www.mountmadonna.org/assets/img/Trail_Map_MMC.pdf'>hiking trails</a> may help orient you to the center.
