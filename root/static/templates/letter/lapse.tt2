Dear $sanskrit, 
<p>
We are reaching out to you as a former member of the
Hanuman Fellowship to ask you to consider rejoining the Fellowship
for the coming year. Whether your membership recently expired or
expired long ago, we sincerely value our relationship with all members
of the Fellowship satsang and respectfully request your continued
commitment as a member of the Hanuman Fellowship.
<p>
The Fellowship is a self supportive community dedicated to the
attainment of peace. We recognize that in order to attain this mission
and carry forward the teachings of Baba Hari Dass through sadhana,
satsang, and karma yoga, a membership based on commitment and service
is essential. Your membership dues provide the needed funding and pledge
of support to projects inspired by the guidance of Babaji such as
Mount Madonna Center, Pacific Cultural Center,
Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple and Mount Madonna Institute.
<p>
We look forward to welcoming you back as a member of the Hanuman Fellowship. 
<p>
The HFS Membership application form and information about the levels
of membership can be found <a href=http://www.hanumanfellowship.org/HFS_Membership_Application.pdf>here</a>.
Please return the application form with your payment to renew your membership.
