Please note:

<ul>
<li>We are working hard to be able to have all transactions available through an online portal, but unfortunately we are not quite there.  Once work on the redesign and launching of the main MMC website is complete, work will proceed on the HFS website and membership payment portal.  We anticipate having this in place for next yearâ€™s membership renewals.</li>

<li>We are attempting to communicate primarily by email, so please make sure that we have your current email address and other contact information.</li>

<li>To claim a Tax Deduction for this donation, you must deduct the value of any benefits you receive.</li>
</ul>
