Dear ${rental.coordinator.first},
<p>
We are looking forward to having your program "${rental.name_trimmed}" here on
${rental.sdate_obj.format("%A, %D")} to ${rental.edate_obj.format("%A, %D")}.
We'd like to get started on your program arrangement details.
Please let me know if you are the preferred contact person,
or if you have a different staff member designated to
coordinate the details below.

<h3>REGISTRATION PROCEDURE</h3>
Here is the web link for registration:
<p>
<ul>
<a target=_blank href='https://akash.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/reg1?id=$rental.program_id'>https://akash.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/reg1?id=$rental.program_id</a>
</ul>
<p>
Registrants will receive a confirmation letter that confirms
their housing assignment,
provides a gate code for after hours access, and other information about
their stay at Mount Madonna Center.
[% ELSE %]
<h3>HOUSING PROCEDURES</h3>
In order to assist you in the housing process,
we have reserved a block of rooms for you and your
program participants.
The following weblink will be used as an
initial housing grid
where you will fill in the names and emails of
your participants.
<p>
<ul>
<a href='${string.cgi}/grid?code=${rental.grid_code}'>${string.cgi}/grid?code=$rental.grid_code
</a>
<p>
</ul>
<p>
The Web Housing Grid lists the Room
#s and identifies the number of beds
in each room. Please fill in the web
grid with the name and email address for each
participant, but only as they fully commit
to your program.
We recommend you reserve a bed
only when you have either received the
appropriate housing payment from your
participant, or you are committed to
paying for the bed yourself. While
we have agreed to provide lodging
for your "maximum" number of
participants listed in the contract, we
cannot guarantee all lodging preferences.
You can assign up to as many people to a room
as there are beds. Housing rates are
based on how many people are in a room,
not the room itself. Please refer to your contract
for housing rates and payment and cancellation policies.
<p>
The last date we can guarantee housing
for your group is 10 days prior to the
start of your program. If we receive
requests for housing after that date,
we cannot guarantee accommodation, even
if you haven't met your contractual
minimum financial commitment for meals
and accomodations.  Should you have cancellations
or withdrawals after the 10 day mark, you may
still incur a charge for those beds.
<p>
If you have questions about the above, please
contact the Guest Services Director at 408-846-4009.
<p>
[% IF rental.seminar_house_sleeping %]
<p>
Since your group is meeting in the Seminar
House, you are committed to paying for at least
11 spaces in that building. The Seminar House
has 16 beds total.
All the rooms in the Seminar House are included in
the preliminary web grid.

<h3>GATE CODE</h3>
Our main entrance gate closes at 6:00 pm daily.
For any arrivals after 6:00 pm, the following gate code will
be required to enter the property: #${gate_code}.
The pound sign is part of the code and each key must
be entered without pause. If you have program participants
staying in the Oaks cabins/campgrounds,
the code for the upper gate is 1${gate_code}.
(No pound sign is required)
<h3>IMPORTANT CAMPING INFORMATION</h3>
Also, please inform any of your camping guests that the campgrounds
are a 10-15 minute walk from the central area. If they do not have
a vehicle, and cannot hand-carry their equipment, it may be best
if they request indoor housing.  Cell
phones do not typically get reception
and there is no wireless connectivity
in the campgrounds. MMC does not
currently provide tents for guests.

<h3>GUEST CONFIRMATION TEMPLATE</h3>
We've attached a template document modeled after the confirmation
note that we automatically send to Mount Madonna guests when they
register for our programs and retreats.  You can modify this document
to fill in the gate codes, particular times and dates of your
program, and include it with information that you provide to your
guests when they register with you.
