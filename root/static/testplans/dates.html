<h2>Entering Dates</h2>
Since MMC is a happening place (totally!) there are gobs of dates in Reg.
<p>
You can enter dates in a variety of formats:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>    mmddyy</td></tr>
<tr><td>    yyyymmdd</td></tr>
<tr><td>    mm/dd/yy</td></tr>
<tr><td>    m/d/y</td><td>(no need for leading zeros)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    m/d</td><td>  (year is the current one)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    m d</td><td>  (year is the current one)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    mmdd</td><td> (year is the current one)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    d</td><td>    (month and year are the current ones)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    t</td><td>    (that's just a 't' meaning 'today')</td></tr>
<tr><td>today</td><td>    (ditto)</td></tr>
<tr><td>e</td><td>(end of time = 12/31/2999)</td></tr>
<tr><td>end of time</td><td>(ditto)</td></tr>
<tr><td>    -2</td></tr>
<tr><td>    +3</td></tr>
</table>
</ul> 
The last two are tricky but quite convenient.
They are relative date offsets to either 'today'
or a start date - depending on context.  For example,
when creating a Program or Rental you enter both a Start Date
and an End Date.  The Start Date can be +4 meaning 4 days from 'today'.
The End Date can be +3 meaning 3 days from the Start Date (whatever
it is).  When creating a Registration you can specify -2 for the
Start Date if someone is coming 2 days early to the program.
i.e. the Registration Start Date is relative to the Program Start Date.
<p>
(At some point we'll have a popup monthly calendar to enable choosing
dates visually - like when you book a flight on travelocity.com).
<p>
In most places dates are displayed like so:
<ul>
    Jan 8<br>
    Oct 10<br>
    Dec 3 '10
</ul>
To explain ... If the year of the date is the same as the
current year it is not shown.
This should hopefully make for a clearer display.
When an existing date is to be changed it is displayed in mm/dd/yy format.
<p>
The default date display format used by everyone can be changed
by the super_admin.  This is not easy but it IS possible.
See the string 'default_date_format' in Configuration/Strings.
There is a Help topic on what the date format characters can be.
