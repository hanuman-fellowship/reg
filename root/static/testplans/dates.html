Since MMC is a happening place (totally!) there are gobs of dates in newReg.

You can enter dates in a variety of formats:

    mmddyy
    yyyymmdd
    mm/dd/yy
    m/d/y       (no need for leading zeros)
    m/d         (year is the current one)
    m d         (year is the current one)
    d           (month and year are the current ones)
    t           (that's just a 't' meaning 'today')
    -2
    +3
    
The last two are tricky but quite convenient.
They are relative date offsets to either 'today'
or a start date - depending on context.  For example,
when creating a Program or Rental you enter both a Start Date
and an End Date.  The Start Date can be +4 meaning 4 days from 'today'.
The End Date can be +3 meaning 3 days from the Start Date (whatever
it is).  When creating a Registration you can specify -2 for the
Start Date if someone is coming 2 days early to the program.
i.e. the Registration Start Date is relative to the Program Start Date.

(At some point we'll have a popup monthly calendar to enable choosing
dates visually - like when you book a flight on travelocity.com).

In most places dates are displayed like so:

    Jan 8
    Oct 10
    Dec 3 10

To explain ... if the year of the date is the same as the
current year it is not shown.
This should hopefully make for a clearer display.
When an existing date is to be changed it is displayed in mm/dd/yy format.

The default date display format used by everyone can be changed
by the super_admin.  This is not easy but it IS possible.
See the string 'default_date_format' in Configuration/Strings.
There is a Help topic on what the date format characters can be.
