<h2>People, Affiliations, Unduplication, Reports</h2>
<h3>Search</h3>
Enter pattern after 'Search For' and  press Submit.
The pattern is actually a 'prefix' of the last name.
You will be shown the first 15 people whose last names
match the pattern.  Upper/lower case does not matter
in the pattern.
<p>
Try searching by Sanskrit, Zip, Email, First, and Home Phone.
The numbers in home phone are not necessarily sequential.
This is okay if you give the full 10 digits
otherwise it is sort of weird - but useful nonetheless.
If the pattern is quoted:
<ul>
'1432'<br>
or<br>
'460-'
</ul>
then it *will* match sequential digits.
<p>
None found? You stay at the search screen.
Your search pattern is preserved so you can easily correct it.
<p>

If there are more search results than will fit on the
page - Try 'Next' until there are no more.
There is also 'Prev'.   Note that the position of the Next and Prev
do not change so your mouse can stay in one place.
<p>
If you wish to see more than the default 15 records per page
you can append a number to the pattern.  Like so:
<ul>
smith 30
</ul>
If there is only one person found that person will be
shown immediately.  No separate step with
a list containing just one person.
<p>
If searching by Last Name you can give
two strings separated by a space.  The first string
will be matched against the last name field and the
second will be matched against the first name field.
And vica versa if you're searching by First.
This can speed the finding by a lot!
<p>
If there is a star '*' in a pattern it will be a 'wildcard'
so you can find people whose names _contain_ the pattern
but not necessarily as a prefix.
E.g. searching for '*ete' will find people whose last name
is 'Peterson' and searching for '*ete *re' will find
'Demeter, Karen'.  The '*' can be in the middle as
well - 'r*z' will find a last name of 'Ratzenberger'.
<h3>Add a Person</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill in all fields (country defaults to USA).
<li>Choose a few affiliations.
<li>Note the two submit buttons (for convenience's sake).
<li>After creation there is a message in red with the person's name.
<li>Click on it to return to their info.
<li>Verify the date of entry.
<li>Give an incorrect State (in the U.S.).
<li>Leave sex unchosen - get error.
Note that the gender is guessed at for you
by consulting www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php.
</ol>
<h3>Quick Access Keys</h3>
You can use the keyboard to invoke various functions
rather than the mouse if you wish.  It might be faster for you.
This is very browser dependent.
On Firefox you press Shift-Alt and the letter key below.
On Safari you press Control.
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>A</td><td>Add</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>Donation</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Edit</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>Leader (make or info)</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td><td>Member (make or info)</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>Next page of results (when viewing search results)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>Prev page of results (when viewing search results)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>make Payment</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Partner With (partner with or view partner)</td></tr>
<tr><td>R</td><td>Register</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>Search</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Undup</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Note that these letters have a subtle light blue background.
<p>
Also note that after search results are shown the first person
has the focus so you can just hit Return to see their information.
In the list the Tab key will take you to subsequent names in the list.
This is nice for the mouse-averse.
<h3>Affiliations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on Configuration/Affiliations at the top.
<li>Edit one.
<li>Create one.
<li>Go to edit a person again and verify that
the edit and the new one are there.
<li>Add the new affiliation to several people.
<li>Go back to affiliation, delete the new one.
<li>Verify it is gone from the people.
<li>And from the list when editing a person.
</ol>
<h3>Miscellaneous People Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Find someone to Delete.<br>
See confirmation dialog.
Verify they were deleted.
<li>Find someone to Edit.<br>
Make a change.
Submit and see the 'updated' message.  Click on the person's name
to see their info.
Verify the date of updating
<li>Map<br>
There is a link at the top named 'Map'.
It jumps to Google maps using the person's address.
Cool?  Yes.  Useful?  Maybe.
<li>Create a duplicate record.<br>
See the warning about <i>possible</i> dups.
It could be exactly same name
or a similar address with first and last initials the same like this:
<ul>
Joe Smith   123 Orange St Tampa, FL 34510<br>
Joseph Smith 123 Orange Street Tampa, FL 34510<br>
</ul>
<p>
Similar dup checks are done after an update of an existing record
(rather than a new creation).  Verify this.
<li>Partners<br>
Partners in this context are used mostly to reduce mailing costs.
Any two people who want to be partnered can simply request it.
Any one who does not want to be partnered any more can simply request
it and it will be done - poof.
<ol>
<li>Choose a person (that is not partnered).
<li>Note the link that says 'Partner With'.
<li>Click on it.
<li>You're asked for a first and last name.
<li>Enter an existing person.  You must spell it exactly.
The two are partnered and their records
now say 'Partnered with ...' - You can click on the
link to go to the partner.
<li>Or enter a person's name that is not in the mailing list.
You will be notified that it is new and will be asked to confirm
the partnering.  If yes, it proceeds.  If not, it is cancelled.
Note the message in either case.
<li>Confirm that the new partner gets the mailing address and home
phone of the original person.
<li>There is 'Separate'.</li>
<ol type=a>
<li>Separate two partners - note the confirmation dialog.
<li>Verify they are no longer partnered.
<li>Delete one of a partnership and note that the undeleted partner
is now no longer partnered.
<li>Edit the address or home phone of a partnered person
and verify that these fields of their partner are updated as well.
and that each person's 'last updated' date is changed to today.
</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
<h3>Unduplication</h3>
Under Listings you will find a link 'Unduplication File'.
This gives a list of <i>possible</i> duplicates.  Since this
list is quite long it is best to
generate it once, save it, and use it to do research.
It shows:<p>
<ol>
<li>Identical first/last names.<br>
Click on one of the names to be taken to an unduplication dialog
for the two people.
If there are 3 or more people with the same name it is better
to do a search for them by last/first name.  You'll know there
are 3 or more if two names in a row in this undup
list are the same.
<li>Unpartnered people with addresses that are 'numerically' close.</li>
For example:<p>
<ul>
123 Orange St Tampa, FL 12341<br>
and<br>
123 Ornge Street Tampa, FL 12341<br>
</ul>
are numerically close.
Clicking on one of these people will also bring you to
the unduplication dialog.
<p>
After a normal search you may see several people who are
in actuality, the same person.  
Searches by last name will reveal some possible duplicates.
Also try using email address.
The process of UNduplicating
these people is tricky and there's a link 'Undup' to help.
This brings you, again, to the unduplication dialog.
<li>Unreported Gender</li>
Also in the unduplication file listing are those with undetermined gender.
(These are not dups but this is as good a place as any to
show this information).  The names in the list
are actually links - they'll take you to the person's
screen.   The gender is guessed at using a special
<a href="http://www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php">web site</a>.
If it looks obvious which gender it should be you can click on the
'Male' or 'Female' link and the gender will be changed.
(Easier than doing edit, click, submit...).
</ol>
<h3>The Unduplication Dialog</h3>
This dialog presents you with complete demographic information.
This also includes the email address, home phone, last date of updating
the person record, how many registrations this person has
(after the name in parens), and whether they're a leader, partner or member.
<p>
You can <i>narrow down</i> which people you see in the dialog by putting 'n'
(lower n for narrow) in the text field next to the people's
names you wish to see.  Press Submit and the non-n people will
be removed to make your decision process easier.
The order of the people is not guaranteed to be the same on the next screen.
<p>
When you have identified who should be merged into whom
put a 'P' (capital P for primary) on the person you want to keep
and an 'm' (lower m for merge) on the people you want to merge
into the primary.  Registrations, donations and credits from
the merged people will be added to the primary person.
Any affiliation, leader or member information for the
merged people will be completely deleted.   A partner of a merged
person will become unpartnered but will be preserved.
<p>
If you see the person and their potential <i>partner</i> on the same screen
you can partner them right here.  Put P and p next to their names.
The p person will be partnered with the P person taking their
address and home phone.  You can't do merging and partnering
at the same time.
<h3>General Reports</h3>
General Reports are found under 'Listings' at the top of the right column.
This is where you can select a subset of all People and produce
nice listings of selected attributes.
<ol>
<li>Create a report - giving a description and some zip code range.
For 'Format' choose 'Name, Address, Email'.
For 'Order By' choose 'Last Name' or 'Zip/Postal Code'.
<li>Run the report.   See the rows on the screen. 
The report can be printed directly or saved, if needed.
<li>Change 'Format' to 'Email to VistaPrint' and re-run.
<li>If you click on the 'Count' button rather than 'Run' you'll get
a count of how many records <i>will</i> appear in the report
when it is run.
<li>Change 'Number of Records' to something less than the count.
ReRun.   This is a random sample of the prior listing's rows.
This is useful when we are selling our list to associated
organizations and they don't want to pay for the whole thing.
<li>Edit the report and select some affiliations.
Now the listing is restricted to people who
have at least one of the affiliations in their record.
<li>Add one of the affiliations to a person not in the
report and verify they now do appear in the rerunning of the report.
If 'Mailings-Snail Mail' is UNchecked the person will not be
included in any report where the postal address is included.
If 'Mailings-Email' is UNchecked the person will similarily not be
included in any report where the email address appears.
<p>
There is also the Person attribute 'Inactive'.
No inactive people should be included in any Report regardless
of their Mailings setting.
Note that when someone is marked 'Deceased' they automatically
become 'Inactive'.
<li>Choose a format of 'Just Email'.
Only people with non-blank emails will be included.
Sorted by email.
<li>Try an invalid zip code range.  Make some mistakes.
Try several zip code ranges in the one field - like this:
<ul>
95060-95062, 89012-89450, 01234
</ul>
<li>Verify you can delete reports.
<li>If you check 'Share' the report will only include
people that have indicated they permit us to share
their demographic information with business associates.
This is the 'Mailings-Share' checkbox on the Person record.
The count of these people is obviously less than without
'Share' clicked.
<li>In the formats other than 'Just Email' note that if both
partners make it into the report
then the partners will be coalesced/merged/joined
into a single record.  Note the different name
that is displayed - if the partners have the same
last name it is not repeated:
<ul>
Mary Smith & John Doe<br>
Penny & Charlie Trager
</ul>
A weakness I just noticed - Partners don't necessarily
have the same work or cell number.
In the Format listing where there are the 3 phone numbers
there is only one work and cell number.
Hmmm.  Not a big problem but not right, either.
<li>If you click 'Collapse' and then 'Run Report'
all people with the same address will be collapsed into one line
whether they are partners or not.  One of the names will be 
chosen to represent the others and this name will be suffixed with 'et. al.'
<li>Try the other report formats.
Try 'Name, Address, Link'
and see the link on the person's name - it takes
you to viewing that person's full record.
</ol>

<h3>Extra Accounts & Payments</h3>
Add an 'Extra Account' in Configuration.
Go to a person's screen and make a 'Payment' into that extra account.
See the list of payments on the person's screen near the bottom.
<p>
<h3>Projects & Donations</h3>
Ditto the above with projects and donations.
One difference between donations and payments
is that payments are included in the deposit but donations are not.
<h3>Registrations</h3>
All of the person's Registrations are listed on the person's page
with the Program name and the start date.   Click on program
name to go to that person's registration for that program.
This is shown only if one of your roles is 'Program Staff'.
<p>
If a person has cancelled a registration and received
a credit this, too, is listed on their page.
