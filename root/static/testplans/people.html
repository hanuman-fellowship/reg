Log In
    (jane, mypass)

Search
    enter pattern, press Submit
    try substring instead of prefix
    try sanskrit, zip, email, first, and home phone.
        the numbers in home phone are not necessarily
            sequential...  this is okay if you give the full 10 digits.
            otherwise sort of weird - but useful nonetheless.
            if the pattern is quoted:
                '1432'
                or
                '460-'
            then it will match exactly (either substring or prefix).
    ask for more/less records (instead of Records per Page = 10).

    None found? You stay at the search screen.
        With _all_ of your search attributes preserved so you
        can easily correct them.

    If more per page than shown - Try "Next 10" until there are no more.

Create a Person
    fill in all fields (country defaults to USA)
    choose a few affiliations
    note the two submit buttons (for convenience's sake)
    in 'created' message - click on person's name to return
        to their info.
        verify the date of entry

    give incorrect State (in the U.S.)
    Leave sex unchosen - get error.
    Give a multiple lined comment and verify
        it looks correct after creation.

Affiliations
    Click on Affiliations at the top
    Edit one
    Create one
    Go to edit a person again and verify that
        the edit and the new one are there.
        Add the new affiliation to several people.
    Go back to affiliation, delete the new one.
        Verify it is gone from the people.
        And from the list when editing a person.

Find someone to Delete
    see confirmation dialog
    Verify they were deleted

Find someone to Edit
    make a change
    put in an invalid State
    submit and see 'updated' message.  click on the person's name
        to see their info.
        verify the date of updating

Create a duplicate record, see the warning about _possible_ dups.
    duplicate could be exactly same name
    or similar address with first and last initials the same:
        Joe Smith   123 Orange St Tampa, FL 34510
        Joseph Smith 123 Orange Stree Tampa, FL 34510
    similar dup checks are done after an update of an existing recrod
        (rather than a new creation).  verify this.
    If a duplicate is found with the checks above, the two (or more)
        people involved will have their records marked "Ambiguous".
        This is turned on automatically.  Turning it off
        needs to be done manually if and when an ambiguity is resolved.
        How about someone in the reception office contacting
        each person with an ambiguous name and asking for
        a middle initial to prepend to the first name?
        Good idea but unlikely to happen. :(

Partners
    Choose a person (that is not partnered).
    Note the link that says "Partner With".
    Click on it.
    You're asked for a first and last name.
    - Enter an existing one - must be exact spelling.
        The two are partnered and their records
        now say "Partnered with ..." - You can click on the
        link to go to the partner.
        And you also have "Separate".
    - Or enter a person's name that is not in the mailing list.
        You will be notified that it is new and will be asked to confirm
        the partnering.  If yes, it proceeds.  If not, it is cancelled.
        Note the message in either case.
    Confirm that the new partner gets the mailing address and home
        phone of the original person.
    Separate two partners - note the confirmation dialog.
        Verify they are no longer partnered.
    Delete one of a partnership and note that the undeleted partner
        is now no longer partnered.
    Edit the address or home phone of a partnered person
        and verify that these fields of their partner are updated as well.
        and that each person's 'last updated' date is changed to today.

Listings
    phone lists
        3 different ones.
        - all include only people with "Phone List" affiliation checked

        #1 note that it is sorted by Sanskrit column
           and that in the absence of a Sanskrit name, first is used.
           no cell phone
        #2 all in one line - not columns
           if only one phone - no letter following, otherwise
           a h, w or c (for home work cell).
        #3 just phone numbers

        in all cases you can print the page - or save it to a file.
            no links at the top for navigation.
        to continue you must use 'Back' button on browser
            or a bookmark to return to the home page of reg2.
        alternatively you can open the phone list
            in a separate tab or separate window - this is
            browser dependent.  All users should be trained
            in how to do this.  This knowledge is useful for ANY use of
            the browser; not just reg.

    Purge Stale Addresses
        Upload a text file containing email addresses.
        They will be removed from people's records.
            (Not from rental, leaders, or users).
        You'll see a count of how many email addresses
            were detected in the file you uploaded.

    Unduplication List
        A list of _possible_ duplicates.
        Generate it once and save it and use it to do research.
        - Identical first/last names.
        - Unpartnered people with addresses that are 'numerically' close.
            e.g.
                123 Orange St Tampa, FL 12341
            and
                123 Ornge Street Tampa, FL 12341
            are numerically close.
    Email check
        this checks all records for invalid email addresses
        and allows you to go directly to the record to edit it.

Reports
    Create a report - giving a description and a zip code range.
    Format - choose "Name, Address, Email"
    Sort - Last Name or Zip
        Run the report.   See the rows on the screen. 
        The report can be printed directly or saved if needed.
    Change format to "Email to VistaPrint" and re-run.
    Change "Number of Records" to something less than the count.
        ReRun.   This is a random sample of the prior listing's rows.
    Edit the report and select some affiliations.
        Now the listing is restricted to people who
            have at least one of the affiliations in their record.
        Add one of the affiliations to a person not in the
            report and verify they get into the rerunning of the report.
    In no case should a person with "Mailings" UNchecked be included
        in any report.
    Choose a format of "Just Email".
        Only people with non-blank emails will be included.
        Sorted by email.

    Try an invalid zip code range.  Make some mistakes.
    Try several zip code ranges in the one field - like this:

        95060-95062, 89012-89450, 01234

    Verify you can delete reports.
    Try the "Count" link instead of "Run" to get
         a count of how many records will appear in the report
         when it is run.

    In the formats other than "Just Email" note that if both
        partners make it into the report (affiliations match)
        then the partners will be coalesced/merged/joined
        into a single record.  Note the different name
        that is displayed - if the partners have the same
        last name it is not repeated:
            
            Mary Smith & John Doe
            Penny & Charlie Trager

        A weakness I just noticed - Partners don't necessarily
        have the same work or cell number - and in the Format listing
        the 3 phone numbers there is only one work and cell number.
        Hmmm.  Not a big problem but not right, either.
