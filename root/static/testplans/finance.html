Extra Accounts
==============
An extra account is basically a place to put money
that has a specific General Ledger number attached to it.
They have descriptions and a gl number and that's it.
These are things like:

    Transportation
    Lost & Found
    Miscellaneous

When viewing a particular person you can choose
"Payment".   Then you enter these items:

    amount
    type        (credit, cash, check)
    what        (for what purpose was this transaction?)
    an Extra Account

These payments are kept in reverse chronological order
at the bottom of the person's screen.
Payments cannot be edited nor deleted.
You can, however, enter an offsetting negative amount...

Finance
=======
This link will bring you to a place where you can create
a deposit for the bank from the monies gathered since
a deposit was last done.   The monies come from 3 different
locations:  Programs, Rentals and Extra Accounts.
Choosing "Make a New Deposit" will show payments with these
attributes:
        Name, Date, Cash, Check, Credit, Online, Program

The program column is the name of the program/rental/extra account.
With totals at the bottom.

Deposits from the past are shown in reverse chronological order.
