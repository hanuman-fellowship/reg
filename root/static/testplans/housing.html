A discursive rambling discussion of how housing works in
Reg for future maintainers of this software.

When people register for a program (or come for a rental)
they have several options for housing.  They could commute
in which case they do not need to stay at the center anywhere.
Similarily they could bring their own van and park it somewhere
and sleep in it.  Others will need a place to rest their weary
heads and there are several options (in decreasing order of cost):

    single with bath
    single
    double with bath
    double
    triple
    quad
    dorm
    economy
    center tent
    own tent

We need to make sure of several things:

    no two people are assigned the same bed
        (with some exceptions like a couple in a tent)
    the genders are not mixed in a room unless they want to be.

so we need to keep track of who is where and what rooms (beds)
are available on any given day.

these things would be nice to do:

    don't mix people in different programs/rentals in the same room
    keep people in the same program close to each other

these tables are used (indented are the columns in that table):

    cluster
        id
        name
        color
    house
        id
        name
        max
        cluster_id
        bath
        tent
        center

        clust_id
        clust_order
        priority

        and for the daily picture display:
        x
        y
    config
        house_id
        the_date
        sex
        cur
        curmax
        program_id
        rental_id
    rental_booking
        house_id
        rental_id
        date_start
        date_end
        h_type
    registration
        h_type
        house_id
        date_start
        date_end
        ... (more that are not relevant to housing).

registration records have a column named 'house_id' which
is a foreign key to the house table.
rental_booking records also have a foreign key to the house table.
with these foreign keys we know what house a person (or rental)
has been assigned.

we also know what date range they have it reserved because
registration records have a date_start and date_end.  rental_booking
records also have these fields (copied from the rental record
they refer to).
