The user should understand the basics of how to use a browser.
Learning these things will benefit all uses of the browser - not just new reg.
These skills include:

- using the Tab key to move to another field in a form.
    and Shift-Tab to go back.  This is often configurable
    in a browser.  In Safari for example one can set it
    so Tab moves to all fields on the page - or not.
    This allows one to tab OUT of a &lt;textarea&gt;, for example.

- understanding radio buttons, check boxes, text fields,
    selecting from a list, submitting a form.

- changing size of all text with menu

- often (not always) you can hit Return instead of the Submit button
    to submit a form.

- how to abandon a form by either closing
    the window or choosing 'Back'.
    sometimes 'Back' is not the right solution and
    can lead to problems - like in creating a registration.

- knowing that you can log in twice (or more) to the new reg.

- Various ways to scroll
    a. scroll mouse
    b. with focus on the window then down/up arrow or page down/up.
    c. clicking on the teensy arrows
    d. clicking in the trough of the scroll bar
    e. clicking and dragging the scroll bar rectangle thingy.

- bookmarks - setting and using

- how to click on a link and open it in a _new_ tab/window

- when you have multiple windows or tabs - to know
    how to switch between them.  especially useful when
    doing unduplications and viewing the calendar.
    knowing how to switch with the keyboard rather
    than the mouse.  also how to easily close a window.
    Alt-F4 on XP will do it.

- knowing how to deal with the browser suggesting completions
    for a field in which you have previous entries.
    Sometimes this entails hitting return twice.

- how to print the screen
    control landscape/portrait, header/footer strings
        in IE on Windows see File-Page Setup
    printing of background colors/images (for Phone Lists)
        in IE on Windows see Tools-Internet Options-Advanced
            then scroll to Printing

- how to go to the previous page - with the mouse and/or the keyboard.
    some people are 'mouse-centric' and will avoid the keyboard
        not sure why.  the keyboard is often much quicker and easier.

- how to click on a 'mail link' and send an email.

- how to use a form to upload a picture or a file.
    for when creating a leader or program and supplying a picture.

- how to search within a web page for a pattern

- how to refresh a page - i.e. regenerate it.
    sometimes this will re-create something unintentionally
    and is not wanted.

- some links have 'access keys' - you can use the keyboard
    to activate them more quickly than clicking on them.
    this is browser and platform dependent.  with select
    input fields you need to use a down/up arrow to show the
    whole list (on Safari at least).

- when a select drop down has focus you can type the
    first letter(s) to move the selected option.
    on Safari it depends how fast you type.

- the browser can optionally fill in a form field for you
    from previously entered data.  this is nice but can
    sometimes be confusing.   sometimes you need to hit
    return twice to get around the 'help' this gives you.
    learn how to turn it off.
    this is very browser dependent.

- copy, cut, paste - keystroke, mouse, menu
    tab into a form field, it is highlighted,
        can copy, cut, paste right away
        can paste into a selected area

- alt-Enter can put IE into full screen mode
    mostly removes the menu, buttons at top which aren't needed
    that often if you are not that mouse-centric.
