The user should understand the basics of how to use a browser.
Learning these things will benefit all uses of the browser - not just new reg.
A lot of today's (and tomorrow's) world is accessed through a browser.

These skills include:

- Going back to the previous page with the Back button or the keyboard.
    If focus is on a text field in a form the normal keyboard back gesture
    will not work.  In Safari there is an alternate Cmd-[ which does.
    Not sure about other browsers.

- using the Tab key to move to another field in a form.
    and Shift-Tab to go back.  This is often configurable
    in a browser.  In Safari for example one can set it
    so Tab moves to all fields on the page - or not.
    This allows one to tab OUT of a &lt;textarea&gt;, for example.

- understanding how to use radio buttons, check boxes,
    text fields, selecting from a list, submitting a form.

- selecting multiple items from a list at once like when adding Rental housing.

    control-click on IE windows
    cmd-click     on Apple

- changing the size of all text with the menu.
    so you can see it better, perhaps.
    keyboard shortcut as well.

- often (not always) you can hit Return instead of the Submit button
    to submit a form.  this _will_ work with in a single line text field.
    some browsers will do this at other types of form elements as well.

- how to abandon a form by either closing
    the window, clicking elsewhere (e.g. navigation at top), or choosing 'Back'.
    sometimes 'Back' is not the right solution and
    can lead to problems - like in creating a registration.

- knowing that you can log in twice (or more) to the newReg.

- Various ways to scroll
    a. scroll button on mouse
    b. with establishing focus on the window then down/up arrow or page down/up.
        the focus cannot be on a text field in a form.
        tricky!
    c. clicking on the teensy arrows
    d. clicking in the trough of the scroll bar
    e. clicking and dragging the scroll bar rectangle thingy.

- Moving to the top and bottom of a page with the keyboard.
    (For quickly getting to the total of mmi payments.)

- bookmarks - setting and using
    in Safari there are keystrokes (cmd-digit) to go
        immediately to a bookmark - nice and quick!

- how to click on a link and open it in a _new_ tab/window

- when you have multiple windows or tabs - to know
    how to switch between them.  especially useful when
    doing unduplications and viewing the calendar.
    knowing how to switch with the keyboard rather
    than the mouse.  also - how to easily close a window.
    On XP Alt-F4 will do it.

- how to print the screen
    control landscape/portrait, header/footer strings
        in IE on Windows see File-Page Setup
    printing of background colors/images (for alternating rows in Phone Lists)
        in IE on Windows see Tools-Internet Options-Advanced
            then scroll to Printing

- how to go to the previous page - with the mouse and/or the keyboard.
    some people are 'mouse-centric' and will avoid the keyboard.
        not sure why.
        the keyboard is often much quicker and easier.

- how to click on a 'mail link' and send an email.

- how to use a form to upload a picture or a file.
    e.g. when creating a leader or program and supplying a picture.

- how to search within a web page for a pattern

- how to refresh a page - i.e. regenerate it.
    sometimes this will re-create something unintentionally
    and is not wanted.  let Sahadev know of any problems.

- some links have 'access keys' - you can use the keyboard
    to activate them more quickly than clicking on them.
    this is browser and platform dependent.  
    
- with select input fields after you tab to them and put the focus there
    you need to use a down/up arrow (or a space) to show the whole
    list (on Safari at least).
    in select fields you can type the first letters of an entry.
    try it! like when choosing a different field to search
    on for People.
    on Safari it depends how fast you type the second character.

- the browser can optionally fill in a form field for you
    from previously entered data.  this is nice but can
    sometimes be confusing.   sometimes you need to hit
    return twice to get around the 'help' this gives you.
    learn how to turn it off.
    this is very browser dependent.

- copy, cut, paste - via keystroke, mouse, menu, context menu
    tab into a form field, it is highlighted,
        can copy, cut, paste right away
        can also paste into an area that you select.

- alt-Enter can put IE into full screen mode
    this mostly removes the menu, buttons at top which aren't needed
    that often if you are not that mouse-centric.
