The user should understand the basics of how to use a browser
These skills include:

- using the Tab key to move to another field in a form.
    and Shift-Tab to go back.  This is often configurable
    in a browser.  In Safari for example one can set it
    so Tab moves to all links on the page - or not.

- understanding radio buttons, check boxes, text fields,
    selecting from a list, submitting a form.

- often (not always) you can hit Return instead of the Submit button
    to submit a form.

- Various ways to scroll
    a. scroll mouse
    b. with focus on the window then down/up arrow or page down/up.
    c. clicking on the teensy arrows

- bookmarks - setting and using

- how to click on a link and open it in a new tab/window

- when you have multiple windows or tabs - to know
    how to switch between them.  especially useful when
    doing unduplications and viewing the calendar.
    knowing how to switch with the keyboard rather
    than the mouse.

- knowing how to deal with the browser suggesting completions
    for a field in which you have previous entries.
    Sometimes this entails hitting return twice.

- how to print the screen

- how to go to the previous page - with the mouse and/or the keyboard.
    some people are 'mouse-centric' and will avoid the keyboard
        not sure why.  the keyboard is often much quicker and easier.

- how to click on a 'mail link' and send an email.

- how to use a form to upload a picture or a file.
    for when creating a leader or program and supplying a picture.
