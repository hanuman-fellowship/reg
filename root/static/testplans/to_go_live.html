<h2>Going Live</h2>
In some rough order of importance:
<ol>
<li>Review the confirmation letter (and cancellation letter)
for style and accuracy.
<li>Transform the web description, leader biography, sums, etc
    into the little Word-style editor syntax.
    No more _, *, ~, - stuff.
    This is needed before we can publish and move staging to live again.
<li>Assign meeting places for rentals/programs.
<li>Add housing clusters to programs.
<li>Complete the rental records - coordinator,
    max, deposit, lunches, housing, etc.
<li>Before publishing, UNcheck 'Web Ready' for all but the
next season's programs.  The ones beyond that are for future
planning's sake only not publication.
<li>Register and house leaders of programs if not already registered/housed.
<li>Check/modify the names of the directories for unlinked programs
    and then publish to web and verify.  This is a different process
    than in old reg.
<li>Cron jobs - start carpool going.
    After changing who the snail mail people email letters go to.
<li>Enter free nights & free program status for sponsor/life members.
Retire the box of index cards.
<li>Some MMI people are registered for more than one D/C/M program.
    We need to delete their registration(s) for the old one.
<li>Need to create the 'parallel' programs for 'MMC Does Registration' rentals.
Or connect up ones that are already there.
<li>Investigate which browser to use - IE, Firefox, Safari, etc.
Safari on Windows might handle opening new tabs better.
<li>We have many people in the mailing list now (again)
who have not contacted the center for years and years.
We can easily Mass Inactivate them - but we need to
determine after what date?
<li>Get high resolution pictures for leaders/programs.
It is a simple thing to send out a request Bcc'ing every leader, yes?
With the ubiquitousness of >5 megapixel cameras there
is no reason we can't get good images.
At a minimum take a picture when the leader comes here!
I suspect some would rather use the image of their younger selves
but that's silly, right? :)
<li>Have the program staff settle on colors for calendar, meeting places, etc.
<li>Also decide on dailypic chars for empty room, resize, etc etc.
I (Sahadev) like a dash for empty rooms - but I'm not a user.
<li>Undup - an ongoing large task.  Time to begin it in earnest.
Also reformatting the foreign addresses.
Perhaps hire someone to do this onerous clerical task?    
Perhaps someone likes doing this kind of detail oriented job.
<li>Remove unused old and unneeded Affiliations.
<li>It is likely not worth entering past proposals, right?
<li>Add any events - such as YSC, Ramayana, Babaji's comings/goings.
<li>Delete bogus rentals/programs - used for accounting purposes?
    like MISC, YTT 500, YTT 500 ADMIN.2, TRANSPORTATION
    SECLUSION, MEMBERSHIP, MOTHERING MAG
    dup'ed INFINITE SMILE rental, etc.
<li>Add anew reports for mailings.  They were not transferred
from old reg because there were so many crufty ones.
Time to rethink these.
<li>Re-enter summaries - using the templates.
    Copy, Paste & Verify.
    Enter programs named "MMI Template" and "MMC Template" with 
    some start, end dates, not web-ready.  Enter summary data for them.
    This will be used for the default summary for MMI and MMC programs/rentals.
<li>Past MMI payments need to be sorted out - following Brajesh's notes
    on the printout?
<li>Add GL Numbers to MMI courses so that auditors' payments
can be given proper GL Numbers (The course GL Number prefixed by 1 or 2).
<li>Inform field staff about the various listings available to them.
<li>More items to be determined as we go along.
</ol>
