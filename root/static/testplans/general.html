General Testing Guidelines

In each of the various categories (People, Reports, Programs, 
Leaders, Housing Costs, Cancellation Policies, etc)
there are create, edit and delete functions.  Try each of these
in each category.

There are many variations on how
the information is presented.  For example, with People
you need to do a search to see them.  In Affiliations and Programs
all are presented in a long list.  In Affiliations you
have Edit and Delete links in the list.  In Programs
you must first view the program before you can edit it.

Required fields are marked with an asterisk.
Verify in each case that you do get an error message
if one is not given.

Errors arise for other reasons as well.  For example:

    - Program and Rental start/end dates
        an invalid format or with end < start.
    - invalid email addresses for people, leaders, rentals
    - non-numeric values for tuition, extra days, etc
    - invalid US state abbreviation
    - program footnotes can only contain *, % or +.
    - etc.

Try to break things and get all the error messages!
On the page that shows you the error there should
be a "Back" button to make it easier to go back.   You
shouldn't need to use the Back button on the browser itself.

The user should be instructed in how to click on a link
and bring it up in a separate browser window or tab.
Unfortunately this is browser and platform dependent.
This now web-based reg _will_ work okay without this knowledge
but the user who is 'in the know' about this will be more effective.
For example, if the user chooses the "Email Check" listing
and gets 10 links with bad emails they're going to want to
click on them all to fix the email field.  If the link opens in the same
window they'll need to click back a lot to get back to the
other links to fix them.  Make sense?
In some cases (Map) the opening of a new window or tab is forced
for these links but it is also good to educate the user in this regard
and give them control.
