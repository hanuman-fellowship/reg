<h2>Programs</h2>
From A to Z.<br>
Cradle to the Grave.<br>
Alpha to Omega.<br>
Soup to Nuts.
<p>
Here we test the new registration program by creating
a program anew, publishing it to the web, registering online,
sending confirmation letters, registering manually,
cancelling, housing, accepting payments when the people arrive,
printing meal lists, housekeeping reports, late notices,
CEUs, participant lists, summaries, etc.  i.e. everything from A to Z.
Oh, and then we have rentals.
<p>
Testing now is crucial.  The old reg evolved over a long
period of time.  This is <i>new</i> software that has not been
subjected to the fire/kiln of time.  There are weaknesses
and frailties that need to be found and remedied.
This is <i>much</i> better done <b>before</b> we 'go live'.
This <b>is</b> work and takes time.  It is important.
I will insist that it is done fully before we 'go live'.
Fully by more than one person even.
<p>
And ... note that a program that is foolproof will
only be used by fools.  Programmers are permitted
to expect that their users have brains and are not afraid
to use them.  Some period of education is to be expected.
And as Babaji has said, "If you know where you are going,
you don't need a map."   So... that said, onward.
<h3>Create a New Program</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preliminaries:
<ul>
<li>Make a new cancellation policy
<li>Make a new housing cost
    that has values that are easily distinguished from the default.
<li>Add the leader as a person (include phone, email).
<li>Make that person a leader (include bio, phone, email, web address).
Also upload a picture of the person.
<li>Add a new affiliation to be used for this program.
</ul>
<li>Add the program
<ul>
<li>Use the 4 tabs in succession before hitting Submit.
You will be warned about missing required fields.
<li>Set the date range to a month in advance of 'today'.
Make it 4 or 5 days long.
<li>No extra days.

<li>Assign the housing cost and the cancellation policy
    you created above.
<li>On the Misc tab "Sponsoring Organization" will be MMC
    unless you are the mmi_admin and are creating

</ul>
<li>Post creation updates</li>
Using the tabs Meals/Lodging and Misc:
<ul>
<li>Set a few days for lunch.
<li>Assign some housing clusters.
<li>Assign the leader you made above.
    Note that while they are automatically registered
    they still need to be housed.
<li>Assign meeting and breakout places.<br>
Notice the effect of the Max of the program.
<li>Add a few affiliations for this program.
</ul>
<li>Publish to the Web</li>
Choose 'Publish' at the top.  It takes a while.
<ul>
<li>Also choose to publish the pictures.
<li>Go to see the page(s) thus generated.
<ul>
<li>Enlarge the pic of the leader.
<li>Check housing prices.
<li>Check start and end times of registration and orientation
    at the bottom of the page.
<li>Check the next and prev program buttons.

<li>Update the bio of the leader.
<li>Re-publish.
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Update the Summary of the program.</li>
It's a link on the right hand side of the program screen.
Enter various details in the various fields.  Learn how
to use the fancy formatting toolbar in multi-line fields.
You can also resize the box by dragging the lower right
hand corner.
<p>
Note that when viewing the Summary you
see various program and leader attributes at the top.
You cannot modify them here - some can be changed on the Program screen,
the Leader screen, or the Person screen for the leader.
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Register Online</h3>
<ul>
<li>See the web page for the program.  When viewing a program
you can chooose the 'Web' link to go to the programs web page.
Note that address of the page is in 'staging2'.
This is not a 'live' page.  Yet.
<li>Enter a recognizable person (a newly created name)
with <i>your</i> email address (so you can receive the confirmation letter)
make some mistakes and get the errors
<li>Choose housing options
<li>Enter some special request.
<li>Finish the page and hit Submit to go on to the verification page
and the pay online page.
<li>Use a credit card number of 411111111111 (4 followed by 1's to fill the field),
expiration date of  0909 (or some mmyy in the future).
<li>Receive the authorize.net notification email.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Get the Online Registrations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Programs link and choose 'Online'.
The online registrations are gotten automatically every 15 minutes
    (during the workday 8:00 am - 6:00 pm Mon-Sat).
    Verify this by waiting until a quarter hour and refreshing the page.
If needed you can choose 'Grab New' to
    get the just-entered online registrations <b>NOW</b>.
<li>Select your registration.
<li>See the special requests, housing options.
The default housing type should be their 1st choice.
<li>Press Submit to save the registration and to go on to do the housing.
<li>Select a house.
Look carefully at the list.
See the order of rooms and the markings (RFOCS).
Verify that rooms in the list are actually available and
that rooms not in the list are not available (for whatever reason).
<li>Finish the registration.
<li>Choose "Send" to send off the confirmation letter.
Receive it in your email.  Check it out carefully.
<li>Verify that the affiliation(s) for the program
got to the person's demographic screen.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Calendar and DailyPic and ClusterView</h3>
Look at these 3 graphical views of the Program/Registration data
and verify that everything looks good and is as expected.
Repeat this verification as you follow the rest of this testplan.
Note these things about the Calendar view:
<ul>
<li>Hovering over the program/rental boxes in the Calendar will display
a window with the details.  If you click on the box you 
will go to that program.
<li>If you click on the Calendar link when viewing a program, rental,
    or registration you will only see the month that that
    event is in (plus the following month in some cases).
<li>Note that 'today' is marked specially.
<li>See the alternating colors for Mon-Thu and Fri-Sun.
<li>Note that the boxes are color coded for each meeting place.
Also note that each meeting place has a fixed vertical location.
<li>See the Personal Retreats at the bottom of each days' column.
Click on the number to see the people's names and their
arrival/departure status.
You can go to a person's registration by clicking on a name.
<li>Next to the Month-Year title there is a little graphic with which you
can more easily scroll to another month.
<li>At the top are ways to change the view.
You can include or exclude the event details table and/or the calendar image itself.  You can reset the start and end dates that are shown.
In these date fields you can enter just two numbers - they will
be interpreted as a month and a year.   e.g. "7 10" is July 2010.
<li>Add some "Events" around the time of the newly created programs.
Give them a meeting place - so they'll appear on the Calendar.
See them on the DailyPic as well.
<li>If an event/rental/program does not have an assigned
meeting place it will still be shown at the bottom of the calendar.
This is the "No Where" location.
</ul>
And note this about the DailyPic or ClusterView:
<ul>
<li>Click on a room and you will see who is in that room.
Click on a person's name and you
will go to the person's registration - or to the Rental.
</ul>
<h3>Repeat</h3>
Repeat the above steps to get a variety of people in the program.
Perhaps 7 or 8 or more.  Here are some variations you can try:
<ul>
<li>Different Gender and Housing choices.
<li>In the special requests field say you want to come early or leave late.
Then in the top date fields on the registration form you
can enter -1 or +2 for a <i>relative</i> date.
For example, the start date of the registration is relative to
the start date of the program.  Ditto for the end dates.
<li>Have someone with kids.
<li>Have someone room with another (who needs to register separately).
See more details below in the 'Shared Housing' section.
<li>Enter license number for a CEU.
<li>Add a confirmation note on the registration screen.
Verify it gets in the confirmation letter.
Click the link to see all 'quick' notes.
See the abbreviations for the notes.
You need to enter the abbreviation yourself at
the beginning of the line. This may be improved at some point.
Add a new note in Configuration/Confirmation Notes.
<li>Add an extra charge to a registration.  Make multiple payments.
<li>Do something creative that has not been tried before!
See if it works as you expect.
</ul>
Verify the charges in each case.  There are many possibilities/combinations.
<p>
<h3>Shared Housing</h3>
When housing a person who has registered online and
has requested to share a rooom with another
there are several possibilities.  Test them all.
<p>
The 'other person' has:
<ul>
<li>Not yet registered for any program and
    cannot be found among the people in our 'mailing list'.
<li>Not yet registered for the program at all.
<li>Registered online but has not yet been processed in Reg.
They can be found in the online list.
<li>Registered but has NOT yet been housed.
<li>Registered and has been housed - but in a different type of room.
<li>Registered for the same program and has already been housed
with the same housing type as their partner's.
</ul>
Try all these possiblities.
<p>
<h3>Manual Registration</h3>
Find someone (anyone, actually - doesn't matter who)
already in the People list and <i>manually</i> register them
for the program by choosing the "Register" link.  You need to
enter a deposit amount, a postmark date, and you need to choose the program
they want to register for.
<p>
Try a person with no email address.
When sending the confirmation letter it will appear on the screen
and you can print it for postal sending (the kind with a stamp).
<p>
<h3>Another Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make <i>another</i> program that has <b>extra</b> days.
<li>Make its date close to the first one above - even abutting or overlapping.
<li>Footnotes of ** (for CEU for MFTs, etc).
<li>Register several people for it online and manually.
<li>Turn Economy or Single Bath or Quad housing off on the program screen.
Verify that these housing types are NOT shown on the web (on the initial
page and when offering the registrant their 1st and 2nd choice)
or in the housing preference lists on the Registration screen
<i>or</i> on the screen where you choose a room.  (Jeeez).
</ul>
<h3>1stReg and AllRegs</h3>
Note the two links 1stReg and AllRegs.
They each have their use.
1st Reg brings you to the 1st registered person alphabetically
and puts the focus on the search field - so you can type
a few characters and hit return and quickly get to another person
that you know.  See the "How?" link for a full explanation of
this
<i>two</i>-way search.
See the "How?" help for the different possibilities.
Do a search that finds people in <i>both</i> programs.
<p>
AllRegs is useful too - to see everyone at once.
Note the unhappy smileys by people who were not
given their first (or even worse their second) housing choice.
If a house opens up, you can sort the list by Postmark (link at top)
and then look for unhappy smileys top to bottom.
There are these other graphics as well:
<ul>
<img src='../images/envelope.jpg' height=20> - Envelope - confirmation letter still needs sending.<p>
<img src='../images/redX.gif' height=20> - Red X - cancelled.<p>
<img src='../images/house.gif' height=30> - Picture of a house - this person still needs to be housed.<p>
<img src='../images/unhappy1.gif' height=20> <img src='../images/unhappy2.gif' height=20> - Unhappy smileys - did not get first/second choice.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Personal Retreat</h3>
Register someone for a Personal Retreat manually and online.
You will need to enter the start and end dates for the registration.
See what happens if you don't.
Make it around the time of the two programs above.
See them arriving and leaving in the calendar (near the bottom of
each monthly calendar).
<p>
<h3><i>Re</i>Housing</h3>
Go back to various registrations and RE-house them
in a different house (by clicking on the existing house name)
or in a different type of house (do an Edit of the registration
to change the housing type).  Verify that the charges
are correct.  Note that this choosing of a different type
of housing can <i>also</i> be done on the very screen where
you are choosing a house.  You can also update
the confirmation note right there as well.
<h3>Listings and Tallies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lists, Tally on Program screen.
<li>Meal lists, Comings and Goings, Housekeeping/Campground Reports
for the various days of the program and before and after.
Find all of these in the Listings link.
Verify all the information is correct.
<li>Late Notices
Usually used only for 'today'
but can time travel by appending a date to the normal url:
<p>
<ul>
        like so:<br>
        http://.../listing/late_notices/20081017<p>
        date is in form yyyymmdd
</ul>
Late notices are only for people who have been housed.
Mark someone as "Arrived" by clicking "Arrived"
(for people who have a zero balance on arrival)
or by paying their balance.
Then they won't appear in the Late Notice listing.
<li>CEUs</li>
Can print many at once from the Program screen
or individually on a registration screen.
Print them <i>landscape</i> and watch for
headers/footers and top/bottom margins.
If the number of hours is not correct (rare?) add it after
a slash in the address bar of the browser and hit return.
Like so for 80 hours of credit:
<ul>
http://kali:3000/program/ceu/2209/80
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Other Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make an affiliation whose name contains "Alert".
Give a person this affiliation.   Put some data in their
comments field.   This comment will 'pop up' at registration time
to alert the registrar.
<li>HSF MEMBERSHIP<br>
Find someone who is an HFS member with a sponsor expiration date
    in the future and who has some free nights.  See how their
    registration charges are affected.
Life members get one free program.
Don't mess with the members other than this.  Shyama is the
    membership secretary and the data in Reg is actually LIVE.
    The number of free nights and the free program can
    be mucked with but not any payments or membership status.
<li>Cancel someone's registration.  Do this <i>only</i> for registrants
that have <i>your</i> email address.  See the cancellation policy.
See the cancellation letter that is emailed (to you).  See the credit
in the person's screen.  Register this person for another program
and see that the credit is applied.
<li>Email everyone in a Program
by choosing the link "Email" when viewing the program.
You are presented with a minimal email composition form.
Be careful with this as you are mailing lots of people!
This uses Bcc when mailing to everyone.
</ul>
