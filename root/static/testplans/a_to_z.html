From A to Z.
Cradle to the Grave.
Alpha to Omega.
Soup to Nuts.

Here we test the new registration program by creating
a program anew, publishing it to the web, registering online,
sending confirmation letters, registering manually,
cancelling, housing, accepting payments when the people arrive,
printing meal lists, housekeeping reports, late notices,
ceus, participant lists, summaries, etc.  i.e. everything from A to Z.
Oh and then we have rentals.

Testing now is crucial.  The old reg evolved over a long
period of time.  This is _new_ software that has not been
subjected to the fire/kiln of time.  There are weaknesses
and frailties that need to be found and remedied.
This is _much_ better done BEFORE we 'go live'.
This IS work and takes time.  It is important.
I will insist that it is done fully before we 'go live'.
Fully by more than one person even.

Log in as 'jane' with password 'mypass'.
    This gives full access.

Create a New Program
    make a new cancellation policy
    make a new housing cost
        have values that are easily distinguished from the default
    add the leader as a person (include phone, email)
    make them a leader (include bio, phone, email, web address)
        also upload a picture of the person.
    add a new affiliation for this program
    create the program
        use the 4 tabs
        set the date a month in advance of 'today'.
            make it 4 or 5 days long
        no extra days
        set tuition and online deposit
            to an unusual amount so you'll recognize it
        set footnotes to * (CEU for nurses)
        assign the housing cost and the cancellation policy
            you created above.
        some things to set after creation choosing Edit:
            set a few days for lunch
            assign some housing clusters
            assign the leader you made above
                note they are automatically registered
                but that they need to be housed.
            assign meeting and breakout places
                notice the effect of the Max of the program
    
Publish to the Web
    Also publish the pictures.
    go to see the page thus generated.
        enlarge the pic of the leader
        check housing prices
    update the web description (or title) of the program, re-publish
        use the shortcuts:
            _underline_
            *bold*
            %url%link%
            ~mailto~
            # numbered list
            - unordered list
    update the bio of the leader, re-publish

    it's a link on the right hand side of the program screen
    Enter various details in the various fields.

        to get the just entered online registration
    select it.
    see the special requests, housing options
        default housing type is 1st choice
    select a house
        look carefully at the list.
        see its order and the markings (RFOCS)
        verify.
    finish the registration
    choose "Send" to send off the confirmation letter
    receive it in your email.

    verify that the affiliation for the program
        got to the person's demographic screen.

Look at the Calendar and DailyPic and verify that
    everything looks good and as expected.
    Repeat this verification as you follow the rest of this testplan.
    Click on the program boxes and see that you go to that program.

Add some "Events" around the time of the newly created programs.
    Give them a meeting place - so they'll appear on the Calendar.
    See them on the DailyPic as well.

Repeat the above steps to get a variety of people in the program.
    Perhaps 7 or 8 or more.
    Variations:
        Gender, housing choices.
        In special requests say you want to come early or leave late.
            In the date fields on the registration form you
            can enter -1 or +2 for a _relative_ date.
        Have someone with kids.
        Have some room with another (who register separately).
        Enter license number for a CEU.
        No email address - see the confirmation letter on the screen
            and print it for postal sending.
        add a confirmation note.
            verify it gets in the confirmation letter.

            see the abbreviations for the notes.
            add a new one in Configuration/Confirmation Notes
    Verify the charges in each case.  Many possibilities/combinations.

Find people (anyone, actually - doesn't matter who)
    already in the People list and _manually_ register them
    for this second program by choosing the "Register" link.

Make _another_ program that has extra days.
    Make its date close to the first one above even overlapping.
    Footnotes of ** (for CEU for MFTs, etc).
    Register several people for it online and manually.
    Other Variations:
        turn Economy or Single Bath or Quad housing off.
        Verify that they're not shown on the web.

Try searching for people in both programs in the Registration screen.
    the two-way search
        (last, first prefixes, * wild cards, program name prefix).
        see the "How?" help.

Add a Personal Retreat
    manually from someone in the People list.
    make it around the time of the two programs.
    see them arriving, leaving in the calendar (near the bottom of
    each monthly calendar).

Go back to various registrations and RE-house them
    in a different type of house.  Verify that the charges
    are correct.

See the list of ALL registrations for a program.
    L - confirmation letter needs sending.
    X - cancelled
    H - needs housing

Get various listings and tallies.
    - Lists, Tally on Program screen.
    - Meal lists, Comings and Goings, Housekeeping/Campground Reports
            for the various days of the program and before and after.
            all in the Listings link.
            verify all the information is correct.
    - Late Notices
        Usually used only for 'today'
        but can time travel by appending /20081103 to the normal url
            like so:
            http://localhost:3000/listing/late_notices/20081017

            date is in form yyyymmdd

        Late notices only for people who have been housed.
        Mark someone as "Arrived" by clicking "Arrived"
            or by paying their balance.
            then they don't appear in Late Notice.
    - CEUs.  Can print many from the Program menu
        or individually on a registration screen.
        Print them _landscape_ and watch for headers/footers.

Other things:

    Make an affiliation whose name contains "pop up".
    Give a person this affiliation.   Put some data in their
    comments field.   This comment will 'pop up' at registration time.

    Make someone an HFS member and give them a sponsor expiration date
    in the future.  Give them some free nights.  See how their
    registration charges are affected.

    Cancel someone's registration.  See the cancellation policy.
    See the cancellation letter that is emailed.  See the credit
    in the person's screen.  Register this person for another program
    and see that the credit is applied.

Rentals
    Another world.  Many things to look at here as well.
    Stay tuned.

To be worked on still:

    Bank deposits - in the Listing screen.
        It should work.  Give it a try.  Let's see what's wrong.

    Month End Report - to be done.

    Cluster Overview - to see all houses in a cluster
        over a two week period.
