From A to Z.
Cradle to the Grave.
Alpha to Omega.
Soup to Nuts.

Here we test the new registration program by creating
a program anew, publishing it to the web, registering online,
sending confirmation letters, registering manually,
cancelling, housing, accepting payments when the people arrive,
printing meal lists, housekeeping reports, late notices,
ceus, participant lists, summaries, etc.  i.e. everything from A to Z.
Oh and then we have rentals.
