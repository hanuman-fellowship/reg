From A to Z.
Cradle to the Grave.
Alpha to Omega.
Soup to Nuts.

Here we test the new registration program by creating
a program anew, publishing it to the web, registering online,
sending confirmation letters, registering manually,
cancelling, housing, accepting payments when the people arrive,
printing meal lists, housekeeping reports, late notices,
ceus, participant lists, summaries, etc.  i.e. everything from A to Z.
Oh and then we have rentals.

Testing now is crucial.  The old reg evolved over a long
period of time.  This is _new_ software that has not been
subjected to the fire/kiln of time.  There are weaknesses
and frailties that need to be found and remedied.
This is _much_ better done BEFORE we 'go live'.
This IS work and takes time.  It is important.
I will insist that it is done fully before we 'go live'.
Fully by more than one person even.

And ... note that a program that is foolproof will
only be used by fools.  Programmers are permitted
to expect that their users have brains and are not afraid
to use them.  Some period of education is to be expected.
And as Babaji has said, "If you know where you are going,
you don't need a map."   So... that said, onward.

Creating a New Program
    1 - Preliminaries:
        make a new cancellation policy
        make a new housing cost
            have values that are easily distinguished from the default
        add the leader as a person (include phone, email)
        make that person a leader (include bio, phone, email, web address)
            also upload a picture of the person.

        add a new affiliation to be used for this program

    2 - Add the program
        use the 4 tabs in succession before hitting Submit
            you will be warned about missing required fields.
        set the date to a month in advance of 'today'.
            make it 4 or 5 days long
        no extra days
        set tuition and online deposit
            to an unusual amount so you'll recognize it
        set footnotes to * (CEU for nurses)
        assign the housing cost and the cancellation policy
            you created above.

    3 - Post creation updates
        use the tabs Meals/Lodging and Misc:

        set a few days for lunch
        assign some housing clusters

        assign the leader you made above
            note that while they are automatically registered
            they still need to be housed.
        assign meeting and breakout places
            notice the effect of the Max of the program

        add a few affiliations for this program
    
Publish to the Web
    Also publish the pictures.
    Go to see the page(s) thus generated.
        Enlarge the pic of the leader
        Check housing prices
        Check start and end times of registration and orientation
            at the bottom of the page.
        Check the next and prev program buttons
    update the web description (or title) of the program in some way
    re-publish
    Update the bio of the leader
    re-publish

Update the Summary of the program.
    it's a link on the right hand side of the program screen
    Enter various details in the various fields.

    Note that when viewing the Summary you
        see various program attributes at the top.
        you cannot modify them here - only on the Program screen.

Register Online
    see the web page for the program
    register online
        enter a recognizable person (a newly created name)
        with _your_ email address (so you can receive the confirmation letter)
        make some mistakes and get the errors
    choose housing options
    enter some special request
    use credit card of 411111111111 (4 followed by 1's to fill the field)
        expire 0909
    receive the authorize.net notification email

Get the Online Registrations
    go to the Programs link and choose 'Online'
        the online registrations are gotten automatically every 15 minutes
            (during the workday 8:00 am - 6:00 pm Mon-Sat).
            verify this by waiting until a quarter hour and looking.
        if needed you can choose 'Grab New' to
            get the just-entered online registrations NOW.
    select your registration
    see the special requests, housing options
        the defaulted housing type should be their 1st choice
    add a confirmation note
        click the link to see all 'quick' notes.
    select a house
        look carefully at the list.
        see its order and the markings (RFOCS)
        verify.
    finish the registration
    choose "Send" to send off the confirmation letter
    receive it in your email.

    verify that the affiliation for the program
        got to the person's demographic screen.

Look at the Calendar and DailyPic and ClusterView and verify that
    everything looks good and is as expected.
    Repeat this verification as you follow the rest of this testplan.

    Click on the program boxes in the Calendar and see that
        you do go to that program.
    Click on a house in the DailyPic or ClusterView
        to go to the person's registration - or to the Rental.

    Calendar
        If you click on Calendar when viewing a program, rental,
        or registration you will only see the month that that
        event is in (plus the following month in some cases).

        Note 'today' is marked specially.
        Alternating colors for Mon-Thu and Fri/Sat/Sun.
        Personal retreats at bottom
        Next to the Month-Year title there is a graphic with
        which you can more easily scroll to another month.

        At the top are ways to change the view.

Add some "Events" around the time of the newly created programs.
    Give them a meeting place - so they'll appear on the Calendar.
    See them on the DailyPic as well.

Repeat the above steps to get a variety of people in the program.
    Perhaps 7 or 8 or more.

    Variations:
        Gender, housing choices.
        In special requests say you want to come early or leave late.
            In the date fields on the registration form you
            can enter -1 or +2 for a _relative_ date.
        Have someone with kids.
        Have some room with another (who need to register separately).
            See below.
        Enter license number for a CEU.
        Add a confirmation note.
            Verify it gets in the confirmation letter.

            See the abbreviations for the notes.
            Add a new one in Configuration/Confirmation Notes
        Do something creative that has not been tried before!
            See if it works as expected.
    Verify the charges in each case.  Many possibilities/combinations.

Note the two links 1stReg and AllRegs.
    they each have their use.
    1st Reg puts you on the search field - so you can type
    a few characters and hit return and quickly get to a person
    that you know.  See the "How?" link for explanation.

    AllRegs is useful too - to see everyone at once.
    Note the unhappy smileys by people who were not
    given their first (or even worse their second) housing choice.
    If a house opens up sort the list by Postmark (link at top)
    and then look for unhappy smileys top to bottom.

When housing a person who has registered online and
    has requested to share a rooom with another
    there are several possibilities.  Test them all.

    The 'other person':

    - has not yet registered for any program and
        cannot be found among the people in our 'mailing list'.
    - has not yet registered for the program
    - has registered but has NOT yet been housed.
    - has been registered and has been housed in a different type of house.
    - has already registered for the same program
        and has already been housed with the same housing type
        as their partner's
    - HAS registered online but has not yet been brought in to newReg.
        they can be found in the online list.

    Try all these possiblities.

Find people (anyone, actually - doesn't matter who)
    already in the People list and _manually_ register them
    for the program by choosing the "Register" link.

    No email address - see the confirmation letter on the screen
        and print it for postal sending.

Make _another_ program that has extra days.
    Make its date close to the first one above even overlapping.
    Footnotes of ** (for CEU for MFTs, etc).
    Register several people for it online and manually.
    Other Variations:
        turn Economy or Single Bath or Quad housing off.
        Verify that they're not shown on the web or in the
        housing preference lists in newReg.

Try searching for people in both programs in the Registration screen.
    the two-way search
        (last, first prefixes, * wild cards, program name prefix).
        see the "How?" help.

Add a Personal Retreat
    manually from someone in the People list.
    make it around the time of the two programs.
    see them arriving, leaving in the calendar (near the bottom of
    each monthly calendar).

Go back to various registrations and RE-house them
    in a different type of house.  Verify that the charges
    are correct.  Note that this choosing of a different type
    of housing can be done in the very screen where
    you are choosing a house.  You can also update
    the confirmation note right there as well.

See the list of ALL registrations for a program.  Note the graphics:

    envelope - confirmation letter needs sending.
    red X - cancelled
    pic of house - needs housing
    unhappy smileys - did not get first/second choice

Get various listings and tallies.
    - Lists, Tally on Program screen.
    - Meal lists, Comings and Goings, Housekeeping/Campground Reports
            for the various days of the program and before and after.
            all in the Listings link.
            verify all the information is correct.
    - Late Notices
        Usually used only for 'today'
        but can time travel by appending /20081103 to the normal url

            like so:
            http://.../listing/late_notices/20081017

            date is in form yyyymmdd

        Late notices are only for people who have been housed.
        Mark someone as "Arrived" by clicking "Arrived"
                (for people who have a zero balance on arrival)
            or by paying their balance.
            then they don't appear in Late Notice.

    - CEUs.  Can print many from the Program menu
        or individually on a registration screen.
        Print them _landscape_ and watch for
            headers/footers and top/bottom margins.
        If the number of hours is not correct add it after
        a slash in the address bar of the browser and hit return.
        Like so for 80 hours of credit:

            http://kali:3000/program/ceu/2209/80

Other variations:

    Make an affiliation whose name contains "Alert".
    Give a person this affiliation.   Put some data in their
    comments field.   This comment will 'pop up' at registration time
    to alert the registrar.

    HSF MEMBERSHIP
    Find someone who is an HFS member with a sponsor expiration date
        in the future and who has some free nights.  See how their
        registration charges are affected.
    Life members get one free program.
    Don't mess with the members other than this.  Shyama is the
        membership secretary and the data in newReg is actually LIVE.
        The number of free nights and the free program can
        be mucked with but not any payments or membership status.

    Cancel someone's registration.  See the cancellation policy.
    See the cancellation letter that is emailed.  See the credit
    in the person's screen.  Register this person for another program
    and see that the credit is applied.

Email everyone in a Program
    by choosing the link "Email" when viewing the program.
    You are presented with a minimal email composition form.
    Be careful with this as you are mailing lots of people!
    Currently it sends one email to everyone on the To: line.
    Will use Bcc: soon.

Extra Accounts & Payments
    Add an extra Account in Configuration.
    Go to a person's screen and make a payment into that extra account.
    See the list of payments on the person's screen near the bottom.

Projects & Donations
    Ditto the above with projects and donations

    One difference between donations and payments
        is that payments are included in the deposit but donations are not.
