Hanuman Fellowship Membership

Memberships can only be maintained by 
a user with the role of Member Admin.

After finding a person, viewing them,
you can say "Make Member".   You fill in 
what kind of membership (General/Sponsor)
and a date.   Then when you click on "Members"
you'll see the person in the list.
When viewing the person you will see "Member Info".

Only the Super Admin role can delete a member
and their payment history.

General memberships have an expiration date.
After that date they will be automatically moved to a Lapsed state.

The link "By Category" will generate a printable
list of members by category and counts.
It doesn't include the Lapsed people.

Sponsoring members pay more regularily (and get further
benefits thereby).  We keep track of their payments
in a history list (displayed below the member info).  
When an individual has paid a total of $5,000 they
become a Life member.  If a partnered couple has jointly paid
$8,000 they both become Life members.
Life members get even more benefits.

The transition to Life membership is handled automatically.
To verify that this works properly takes a lot of testing!
Many different situations need to be verified.

Sponsoring members become Lapsed members if they
have not paid anything for 3 months.  Is this right?
Probably not.   Someone might want to pay an entire
years dues (how much?) at once to save the clerical burden.
