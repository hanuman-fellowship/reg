Listings

There are many listings, many ways of viewing the data in newReg.

They're listed here with brief indications of how
and when and who might use them.  Each leading dash '-' below
is a separate listing.

- Late Notices For Today
    This is run once daily at the end of the day
    to alert the program staff of who might be coming
    after office hours.  The notice includes where the person is
    housed and whether they have an outstanding balance or not.

Meal Lists
    - For Planning
        This shows the counts of who will be eating
        breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next two weeks.
    - Today With Names
        Who is eating breakfast, lunch and dinner today?
        This could be used as a check-off to catch people
        who still need to pay.
    - Custom:
        Fill in a start date, end date and whether you
        want people's names.  Hit Go and you get
        the meal list custom made to your specifications.
        Like Burger King's phrase - "Have It Your Way".

- Today's Comings and Goings
    Who is coming and going today?
    Totals of people in Programs and Rentals.
    Personal Retreats - it lists the names.
    While here you can go next and back to see other days.

    Also:

    - On &lt;date&gt; Go
        Same as above except you specify a start date.

- Unduplication File
    This long list is used to see possible duplicates,
    possible partners, and people of undetermined gender.
    Once see you can have a try at resolving the issue.
    You can click on people's names and go directly to their records.
    Resolving a gender issue is facilitated by a web request
    and should be sort of fun.  This tedious work will end up
    saving the center a good bit of money in mailing costs.

    In the People testplan there are further details on the
    unduplication process.

- Email Check
    This looks at all email addresses and reports on ones
    with an invalid syntax.  Some should be able to be corrected
    easily.

- Last Active By Year
    Does a tally of everyone and shows when people were last active.
    Useful to determine when to mark people actually Inactive
    so that we don't send them any more mailings.

- Last date of contact before which
  people should be marked inactive:
    This is used to do a mass marking of inactive people.
    Use the listing above first to determine the date.

- Purge Stale Addresses
    Upload a text file containing email addresses and hit Go.
    Those addresses will be removed.  Useful when we get a list
    of bounced email addresses back.

- General Reports
    See the People testplan for full details on this.

- Deposit 1. Reconcile
        - 2. File
    Gather all payments (Registration, Rental, Extra Accounts)
    since the last time we made a deposit.  The reconcile version
    is sorted by name and helps in jiving it with the checks, receipts, etc.

    The File version is for printing and filing away.  This actually
    makes the deposit final.  Only one deposit is allowed per day.

- Prior Deposits
    See all prior deposits.  You can see the Reconcile or File version of it.

    Note that if you are logged in as an MMI Admin you will
    be able to make and see deposits of MMI Payments.
