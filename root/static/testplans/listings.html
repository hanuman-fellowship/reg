<h2>Listings</h2>
There are many listings, many ways of viewing the data in Reg.
<p>
They're listed here with brief indications of how
and when and who might use them.
There are 4 broad categories of listings
(<a href=#people>People</a>, <a href=#financial>Financial</a>, <a href=#field_staff>Field Staff</a>, and <a href=#kitchen>Kitchen</a>)
plus these two:
<ul>
<li>Late Notices For Today
<p>
This is run once daily at the end of the day
to alert the program staff of who might be coming
after office hours.  The notice includes where the person is
housed and whether they have an outstanding balance or not.

<li>Today's Comings and Goings<p>
    Who is coming and going today?
    Totals of people in Programs and Rentals.
    Personal Retreats - it lists the names.
    While here you can go next and back to see other days.
<p>
    Also:
    <ul>
    <li>On &lt;date&gt; Go<p>
        Same as above except you specify a start date.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>People</h3>
<ul>
<li>General Reports<br>
    See the People testplan for full details on this.
<li>Phone Lists<br>
    <ol>
    <li>In Columns
    <li>In One Line
    <li>No Address
    </ol>

These are phone lists of people in the fellowship in 3 different formats.
Each has their use.
All include only people with the "Phone List" affiliation checked.

<ol>
<li>Note that it is sorted by the Sanskrit column
and that in the absence of a Sanskrit name, the first name is used.
No cell phone.
<li>All in one line - not columns.
If only one phone - no letter following, otherwise
h, w, or c (for home, work, or cell) is appended.
<li>Just name and phone numbers - no address.
</ol>
In all cases you can print the page - or save it to a file.
There are no links at the top for navigation.
To continue you must use the 'Back' button on the browser
or a bookmark to go elsewhere.
Alternatively, you can deliberately open the phone list
in a separate tab or separate window which you can then just close.
</li>
<li>Unduplication File<br>
    This long list is used to see possible duplicates,
    possible partners, and people of undetermined gender.
    Once see them you can have a try at resolving the issue.
    You can click on people's names and go directly to their records.
    Resolving a gender issue is facilitated by a web request
    and should be sort of fun.  This tedious work will end up
    saving the center a good bit of money in mailing costs.
<p>
    In the People testplan there are further details on this
    unduplication process.

<li>Email Check<br>
    This looks at all email addresses and reports on ones
    with an invalid syntax.  Some should be able to be corrected
    easily.

<li>Last Active By Year<br>
    Does a tally of everyone and shows when people were last active.
    Useful to determine when to mark people actually Inactive
    so that we don't send them any more mailings.

<li>Last date of contact before which
  people should be marked inactive:<br>
    This is used to do a mass marking of inactive people.
    Use the listing above first to determine the date.

<li>Purge Stale Addresses<br>
    Upload a text file containing email addresses and hit Go.
    Those addresses will be removed.  Useful when we get a list
    of bounced email addresses back.

</ul>

<h3>Financial</h3>

<li>Deposit
    <ol>
    <li>Reconcile
    <li>File
    </ol>
    Gather all payments (Registration, Rental, Extra Accounts)
    since the last time we made a deposit.  The reconcile version
    is sorted by name and helps in jiving it with the checks, receipts, etc.
<p>
    The File version is for printing and filing away.  This actually
    makes the deposit final.  Only one deposit is allowed per day.

<li>Prior Deposits<br>
    See all prior deposits.  You can see the Reconcile or File version of it.
<p>
    Note that if you are logged in as an MMI Admin you will also
    be able to make and see deposits of MMI Payments.

<li>Period End Summary<br>

    You'll see all payments and deposits in that time frame
    broken down by cash, check, credit.

    want people's names.  Hit Go and you get
