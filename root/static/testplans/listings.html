<h2>Listings</h2>
There are many listings, many ways of viewing the data in Reg.
<p>
They're listed here with brief indications of how
and when and who might use them.
<ul>
<li>Late Notices For Today
    This is run once daily at the end of the day
    to alert the program staff of who might be coming
    after office hours.  The notice includes where the person is
    housed and whether they have an outstanding balance or not.

<li>Meal Lists
    <ul>
    <li>For Planning
        This shows the counts of who will be eating
        breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next two weeks.
    <li>Today With Names
        Who is eating breakfast, lunch and dinner today?
        This could be used as a check-off to catch people
        who still need to pay.
    <li>Custom:
        Fill in a start date, end date and whether you
        want people's names.  Hit Go and you get
        the meal list custom made to your specifications.
        Like Burger King's phrase - "Have It Your Way".
    </ul>
    People with a role of kitchen_staff will only see
    the above listings.
<li>Today's Comings and Goings<p>
    Who is coming and going today?
    Totals of people in Programs and Rentals.
    Personal Retreats - it lists the names.
    While here you can go next and back to see other days.
<p>
    Also:
    <ul>
    <li>On &lt;date&gt; Go<p>
        Same as above except you specify a start date.
    </ul>

<li>Unduplication File<br>
    This long list is used to see possible duplicates,
    possible partners, and people of undetermined gender.
    Once see them you can have a try at resolving the issue.
    You can click on people's names and go directly to their records.
    Resolving a gender issue is facilitated by a web request
    and should be sort of fun.  This tedious work will end up
    saving the center a good bit of money in mailing costs.
<p>
    In the People testplan there are further details on this
    unduplication process.

<li>Email Check<br>
    This looks at all email addresses and reports on ones
    with an invalid syntax.  Some should be able to be corrected
    easily.

<li>Last Active By Year<br>
    Does a tally of everyone and shows when people were last active.
    Useful to determine when to mark people actually Inactive
    so that we don't send them any more mailings.

<li>Last date of contact before which
  people should be marked inactive:<br>
    This is used to do a mass marking of inactive people.
    Use the listing above first to determine the date.

<li>Purge Stale Addresses<br>
    Upload a text file containing email addresses and hit Go.
    Those addresses will be removed.  Useful when we get a list
    of bounced email addresses back.

<li>General Reports<br>
    See the People testplan for full details on this.

<li>Deposit
    <ol>
    <li>Reconcile
    <li>File
    </ol>
    Gather all payments (Registration, Rental, Extra Accounts)
    since the last time we made a deposit.  The reconcile version
    is sorted by name and helps in jiving it with the checks, receipts, etc.
<p>
    The File version is for printing and filing away.  This actually
    makes the deposit final.  Only one deposit is allowed per day.

<li>Prior Deposits<br>
    See all prior deposits.  You can see the Reconcile or File version of it.
<p>
    Note that if you are logged in as an MMI Admin you will also
    be able to make and see deposits of MMI Payments.

<li>Period End Summary<br>
    Specify a start and end date and hit Go.
    You'll see all payments and deposits in that time frame
    broken down by cash, check, credit.

<li>Phone Lists<br>
    <ol>
    <li>In Columns
    <li>In One Line
    <li>No Address
    </ol>

These are phone lists of people in the fellowship in 3 different formats.
Each has their use.
All include only people with the "Phone List" affiliation checked.

<ol>
<li>Note that it is sorted by the Sanskrit column
and that in the absence of a Sanskrit name, the first name is used.
No cell phone.
<li>All in one line - not columns.
If only one phone - no letter following, otherwise
h, w, or c (for home, work, or cell) is appended.
<li>Just name and phone numbers - no address.
</ol>
In all cases you can print the page - or save it to a file.
There are no links at the top for navigation.
To continue you must use the 'Back' button on the browser
or a bookmark to go elsewhere.
Alternatively, you can deliberately open the phone list
in a separate tab or separate window which you can then just close.
</li>
</ul>
Note: The following lists are the only ones that will be seen
    by users with the field_staff role.
<ul>
<li>Room Make Up List<br>
    A list of rooms that need attention as they were recently vacated.
    You check the ones that have been already tidied up and hit
    Submit to make them go away from this list.
    You are shown when each room will be needed next.
    For convenience there is 'All' for when an entire
    cluster needs to be checked.
