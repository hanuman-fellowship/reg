Users log in to newReg with a name and password.

If the user is inactive for 2 hours their session will be terminated and
they will need to log in again.

The password can be changed by choosing Configuration/Password, Name, Email.
The dialog can also be used to change your first and last names
and email address.  Your login name cannot be changed.

The key to achieving some level of system security is
having passwords that are hard to guess.
Enforcing password complexity
is a simple way to ensure a minimum level of security.
The level of password complexity can be changed by the super_admin
by modifying the String 'password_security'.
It can be either 0, 1, or 2.

0 - No restrictions at all on the password.
1 - The password must be at least 4 characters
    and not contain only lower case letters.
2 - The password must be at least 6 characters and must
    contain a lower case letter, an upper case letter,
    a digit, and a punctuation character.

After logging in successfully users assume a given role.
Here are the names of the roles and a short description of what
they are allowed to do:

- Super Admin
- Program Admin
- Program Staff
- MMI Admin
- Mailing List Admin
- Mailing List Staff
- Field Staff
- Kitchen Admin
