<h2>Blocks</h2>
One reserves housing at MMC in two main ways:
via Program registrations or via Rentals.
There is a third way: Blocks.
<p>
There are (at least) two circumstances where this is useful:
<ol>
<li>A leader is housed in RAM 1A.  You don't want anyone
else in the entire RAM 1 room.  So you make
blocks for RAM 1B and RAM 1C for the date range.  No people
will be in these rooms - you just want to prohibit anyone
from using them.
<li>A family or group of friends comes for a PR.
It is not worth the trouble to register each individual separately.
You register one of the group and manually adjust their finances
to reflect the total cost.  You then make blocks to reserve
the housing.  You specify that people will be occupying the space
so that meal and field staff lists are accurate.
</ol>
<p>
Choose Configuration-Blocks and you will see
a list of all current and future blocks ordered by start date.
You can give a start date to see the next 10 blocks from that date.
<p>
Clicking on the room name will view the full details of the block.
<p>
There is the usual 'Add' to create a block.
Blocks have these attributes:
<ul>
<li>Start Date
<li>End Date
<li>Room Name
<li>Brief Reason
<li># of Beds
<li># of People
<li>Comment
</ul>
All are required except for Comment.
You must type the room name precisely.
(Note that in this context the term 'room' includes tent sites.)
When you submit the form the system will see if the room
has that many free beds in the given date range.  If so, that space
is reserved and cannot be used by any other Program or Rental.
This block reservation will be shown in the DailyPic and ClusterView
and when you click on the room you will see the brief reason.
<p>
Note that the end date of the block is the day it is released.
The night before is the last night it is occupied.  This is how
program registrations work as well.
<p>
If you leave the # of Beds blank it will default to the size of the room.
If you leave the # of People blank it will default to zero.
<p>
As usual, blocks can be edited and deleted and the housing
reservations will be adjusted.
<p>
Like a housing FORCE, blocks do not respect Program Cluster Reservations.
The person doing these acts takes responsibility.  Their name
and a date/time stamp is shown when viewing the block.
<h3>Bound Blocks</h3>
Most blocks arise due to a Program/Rental housing need.
Instead of creating a block as above (Configuration-Blocks-Add)
you can view the Meals & Lodging tab of a Program/Rental
and choose 'New Block'.  The same block creation form is used
to create the block.  The difference is that this block
is now associated with the Program/Rental.  Let's call this
type of block a Bound Block (it is bound to the Program/Rental).
When viewing the DailyPic or ClusterView you will see the block
(with the B's) and its background color will be taken from
the Program/Rental.  This allows you to see at a glance which
happening it belongs.
<p>
You can also create blocks bound to Events.
Events do not have colors (yet).
<p>
When viewing Programs/Rentals/Events you are shown
the list of that happening's bound blocks.  You can click
on them to view the block and can then delete it if you wish.
<h3>Meeting/Sleeping Places and Automatic Bound Blocks</h3>
Some meeting places can serve double duty as sleeping places.
When these meeting places are assigned to a Program/Rental/Event
a bound block is automatically created to prevent those
spaces from inadvertently being used for sleeping.  When such a meeting place
is UNassigned the automatic bound block is cleared.
