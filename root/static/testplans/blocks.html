<h2>Blocks</h2>
One reserves housing at MMC in two main ways:
via Program registrations or via Rentals.
There is a third way: Blocks.
<p>
There are (at least) two circumstances where this is useful:
<ol>
<li>A leader is housed in RAM 1A.  You don't want anyone
else in the entire RAM 1 house.  So you make
blocks for RAM 1B and RAM 1C for the date range.  No people
will be in these rooms - you just want to prohibit anyone
from using them.
<li>A family or group of friends comes for a PR.
It is not worth the trouble to register each individual separately.
You register one of the group and manually adjust their finances
to reflect the total cost.  You then make blocks to reserve
the housing.  You specify that people will be occupying the space
so that meal and field staff lists are accurate.
</ol>
<p>
Choose Configuration-Blocks and you will see
a list of all current and future blocks ordered by start date.
You can give a start date to see the next 10 blocks from that date.
<p>
Clicking on the house name will view the full details of the block.
<p>
There is the usual 'Add' to create a block.
Blocks have these attributes:
<ul>
<li>Start Date
<li>End Date
<li>House Name
<li>Brief Reason
<li># of Beds
<li># of People
<li>Comment
</ul>
All are required except for Comment.
You must type the house name precisely.
When you submit the form the system will see if the house (actually a room
or a tent site - but 'house' is the accepted misnomer)
has that many free beds in the given date range.  If so, that space
is reserved and cannot be used by any other Program or Rental.
This block reservation will be shown in the DailyPic and ClusterView
along with the brief reason.
<p>
Note that the end date of the block is the day it is released.
The night before is the last night it is occupied.  This is how
program registrations work as well.
<p>
If you leave the # of Beds blank it will default to the size of the house.
If you leave the # of People blank it will default to zero.
<p>
As usual, blocks can be edited and deleted and the housing
reservations will be adjusted.
<p>
Like a housing FORCE, blocks do not respect Program Cluster Reservations.
The person doing these acts takes responsibility.  Their name
and a date/time stamp is shown when viewing the block.
<p>
Finally, if you edit an existing block and leave it in a
flawed state it will be marked with an unhappy face in the list.
One way to leave a block in a flawed state is to request a new date
range that is not available.  You will be given an error.
If at this point you do not go back to fix it - but click away
or close the window the block will have lost its original house and will
be in a flawed state.
