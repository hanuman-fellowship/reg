<h2>Rentals</h2>
<p>
A call comes for a proposed rental.
<h3>Fill out a Proposal</h3>
    First choose Rentals from the top menu.
    Then choose the Proposals link.
    Then Add.
<ul>
    <li>Contact Person<br>
    Note the required fields.
        On leaving the last name field, Reg will fill
        in the rest from prior data, if it is available.
    <li>IF the Contract Signer is different from the contact person
        there is a link 'Contract Signer?' which will open up an
        additional area to enter the info.
        This also auto fills from prior data.
    <li>Max
    <li>Dates requested<br>
        This can be as verbose and as vague as you wish.
    <li>Default check in is 4:00, default check out is 1:00
        You CAN put hh:mm for minutes.  Like 4:30.
        No need to enter am/pm because it is assumed
        that 8:00 is am and 7:00 is pm.  This is okay, yes?
    <li>Program meeting date is important.
    <li>Deposit field is required.
</ul>
<p>
    The several multiline text fields have a fancy editor for 
        Word-like formatting.
<p>
    After entry you see the list of all proposals.
    They are listed in order of program meeting date.
        Only current or future ones are shown
        Can search for others by the group name.
            * is wildcard

    Can edit/update/delete them as usual.
<p>
The program meeting then happens and decisions are made
    to approve or deny the proposals.
<h3>Deny</h3>
    If deny,
        Choose Edit, check deny and possibly put a reason in Miscellaneous Notes.
        Then click 'Transmit' to move contact person (and contract signer)
            to People for later reference.
<h3>Create a Rental</h3>
    If approve - click 'Approve'.
        This brings up a Rental creation screen (in a new window)
            with these fields already filled in from the information
            in the proposal:

<ul>
<li>Check in, Check out
<li>Tentative
<li>Rental Name (the proposal group name)
<li>Contact Person/Contract Signer come over
<li>Max
<li>Deposit
</ul>

Note that the Rental screen has 4 tabs:
<ol>
<li>Meals & Lodging
<li>Misc
<li>Finance
<li>Web
</ol>
Fill in start, end date and hit Submit.
A rental is thus created.
<p>
The Rental's Summary is automatically created.
    Note that Special Needs, Food Service,
    Leader Housing, Misc Notes, Provisos, etc
    are taken directly from the Proposal.
<p>
        The Contact Person and Contract Signer in the proposal
            are automatically 'transmitted' to the People table
            with affiliation 'Proposal Submitter'.
<p>
After a Proposal is 'Approved' you can no longer modify it.
    You can go back and forth between the Proposal and the Rental
    with links (To Rental/To Proposal) on each screen.
    Similarily, after the contact person (and contract signer)
    have been 'Transmitted' you cannot modify them on the Proposal.
    Instead, you modify their info in the People screen.
    From the Proposal and the Rental you can get to the people
    screen in one click on a link.
<p>
Rentals can also be created directly without going through
    the proposal process.  Choose 'Add' on the Rentals list screen.
    One difference is that you need to add the contact person
    separately in People and then retype their name after
    choosing 'Update' next to the Contact Person field in Rentals.
    Similarily for contract signer if not the contact person.
<p>
Several other things need to be done to make the rental complete:
<ul>
<li>Choose the appropriate housing cost.
Note that it cannot be the default - the default
is for Programs and Personal Retreats not Rentals.
If the rental will be having lunches the housing cost
should reflect this - the housing cost name must contain
the word 'lunch'.
<li>Assign meeting places and breakout places.
<li>Choose which days have lunches.
Note that if the rental begins after 1:00 they
cannot have lunch on the first day.
<li>Verify the GL Number which was automatically computed.
<li>Enter any comment and web information, if provided.
        The web stuff will appear on the Events Calendar
            at www.mountmadonna.org.
        Some organizations won't want their information public
            but some will.  From an MMC perspective I think it is nice
            to be able to show that there are many other things
            happening at the center.
</ul>
<h3>MMC Does Registration and Parallel Programs</h3>
The item 'MMC Does Registration' is normally unchecked.
<p>
For special rentals (like AVI and OGS) MMC does the individual
registration for them but it <i>is</i> still a Rental - from a financial
and contractual perspective.  In order to do the registrations
and generate a web page on which people can register online you
will need to create a <i>parallel</i> 'Program' with the <i>same name</i> and
the <i>same dates</i> as the 'Rental'.  You will not be
able to assign any meeting spaces or breakout spaces to this program.
This program will not appear on the calendar at all - not even
in the 'No Where' place.  The original rental <i>will</i> appear.
<p>
To help you to not forget to create this parallel program newReg
will bring you to a Program creation dialog when you first check
'MMC Does Registration' on the Rental screen.  The name and dates
will be filled in from the rental.  The rest of the program attributes
(including the web page information) is up to you.
<span style="color: red">Do not change the name or the dates!</span>
You <i>can</i> but you would only confuse yourself and others!
<p>
Once the parallel program is created you can easily go back and forth
between the rental and its program with the 'To Program' and
'To Rental' links.
<p>
In the lists of all rentals and programs
these special rentals and their parallel programs will be
marked with a percent '%'
</ul>
<h3>Contract</h3>
Once the rental is complete you can generate a contract
    by simply choosing 'Contract' and printing it.
    This is a legal document and hence needs to be examined
    and vetted carefully.
    Double check the housing costs.  Seminar house use
    affects the contract.  Lunches do, too.
    Try the various combinations.
    Read the meal times carefully.
<p>
Generating the contract will put the current date in the
    'Contract Sent' field and change the status from 'Tentative'
    to 'Sent'.  The contract should be sent to the contact
    person for signature and a request for a deposit check.
<p>
When the contract is received back the rental should
    be edited to put the date of contract reception in the
    Contract Received field.
    The deposit check should also be entered as a Payment (in the
    Finance tab).  The rental status is now 'Received'.
<p>
Each status of a rental has its own color - which can be
    changed by the super_admin in Configuration/Strings.
    This color is prominently visible when viewing the rentals
    and also as a <i>border</i> color in the Calendar.
<h3>Arrangements</h3>
The MMC Rental Coordinator can now begin the conversation
    about the arrangements - all the things in the Summary.
    There is an ongoing conversation about how many
    people will be coming and what kind of housing
    they will want.  This information is entered into the
    Meals/Lodging tab of the Rental.
<p>
Entire housing clusters can be booked (or cancelled) for a rental
    in one fell swoop.
<p>
When booking rooms individually you can select more than
    one at a time from the select list by holding down the
    control key while clicking the room names - and then
    pressing Submit.
<p>
On the Meals/Lodging tab to the right of the number of people
    there is a color:
<dl>
<dt><span style="background: green; color: white">Green</span>
<dd>More rooms need to be picked to adequately cover
            the housing needs.
<dt><span style="background: Red; color: white">Red</span>
<dd>Too many rooms have been picked.  You can delete
            some by clicking on their name.
<dt><span style="background: white; color: black">White</span>
<dd>All is covered just right.
</dl>
<h3>Post Rental</h3>
The Rental comes and all hopefully goes well.
    At this point the coordinator asks the contact person the
    question - 'What Happened?'  This is when we find out
    that some people came late, some left early.  This affects
    the 'Attendance' field for each housing type.  It can
    get very complicated dealing with the shifting numbers of
    people in the rooms.  There is a help link 'How?' near
    the Attendance field that explains a few things of importance.
<p>
If there were some people that did not attend the entire
    rental this fact will be reflected in the number at the bottom
    entitled 'Days of Non-Attendance'.  This is like a 'check number'
    to help you verify that you entered the multiple 'people x days'
    terms correctly.
<p>
The coordinator can choose 'Invoice' to get a nicely laid out and
    accurate invoice to print for the contact person.  Actually,
    it is as accurate as the input data.
<p>
A check is made out for the unpaid balance and it is entered
    as a Payment on the Rental.  The status of the Rental changes to 'Done'.
<p>
If the payment was not made on the last day of the Rental 
    the status becomes 'Due' - with its own unique color to 
    make it stand out.
