<h2>MMI Programs</h2>
For programs offered by Mount Madonna Institute (henceforward MMI)
the 'sponsoring organization' of the program is not MMC.
It is one of these:
<ul>
<li>MMI College of Ayurvda
<li>MMI School of Professional Massage
<li>MMI School of Yoga
<li>MMI School of Community Studies
</ul>
You then need to specify a level:
<ul>
<li>Diploma
<li>Certificate
<li>Masters
<li>Course
</ul>
If it is not a Course then it is refered to as a DCM program.
MMI Courses/DCMs are marked with a red star in the list of programs.
<p>
Actually, to see current Personal Retreats and DCMs you must
choose "PR/DCM" on the program list page OR
do a search for a program with a pattern (or season/year).
These are not normally included because they are
ever-present (or present for months at a time unlike
most programs that are typically just a weekend)
and become a kind of noise.  Note also that these
special programs do not allow the specifying of lunch days.
<p>
MMI Programs, at this time, do not have web pages - and hence
no on-line registration.  People have to actually <i>apply</i> to
be a student of the Institute - just like any accredited school.
Application forms <i>are</i> available at the MMI web site.
<p>
Since MMI Programs have no web page 
"Web Ready" is forced to be off when creating/updating the program.
This goes for "Linked" and "Unlinked Dir" as well.
<p>
Registrations for an MMI <i>course</i> are facilitated by the "Import"
link on the course Program page.  You are presented with 
the DCM programs that are concurrent with the course date range.
You choose one or more DCM programs and everyone in
these programs is registered for the course.  The housing
type choice is assigned individually - based on the most recent
housing type they were assigned.  If the DCM course is in winter,
tenting choices are avoided.  Double is the default type.
The housing type is set but the registrar still needs to go through
and house everyone individually.
<p>
People can register for only one DCM program at a time.
Such second registrations are prohibited.  When viewing
a registration in an MMI <i>course</i> there is a link "To DCM"
with which you can jump to their DCM registration.
<p>
Tuition for DCM Programs is quite flexible depending on
their ability to pay.  Various creative discounts for payment
in full, etc.  So ... we don't really record the tuition <i>charges</i>.
The comment field in the DCM program registration screen
is used extensively to detail the payment arrangements that
have been made.
<p>
<h3>MMI Payments</h3>
We DO, however, keep close track of the <i>payments</i>.  All MMI Payments
are linked directly to the person not to the registrations.
On any MMI program registration screen there
is a section at the bottom named "MMI Payments" with
links "New" and "List".
<p>  
Choosing "New" to create a new MMI payment
you supply a dollar amount, type (credit/check/cash), what the payment
is for (Tuition/Meals&Lodging/Fees/...) and an optional note.
<p>
For general ledger accounting purposes MMI Programs
do not really have a single GL number.  Each MMI payment has its <i>own</i>
6 digit GL number which is automatically computed thusly:
<ul>
<li>digit 1 - what for (1=Tuition, 2=Meals & Lodging, 3=Application Fee,
                    4=Registration Fee, 5=Other)
<li>digit 2 - school (1=Ayurveda, 2=Massage, 3=Yoga, 4=Community)
<li>digit 3 - tens digit of year
<li>digit 4 - units digit of year
<li>digit 5 - month (1=Jan, ...  9=Sep, X=Oct, Y=Nov, Z=Dec)
<li>digit 6 - level (D=Diploma, C=Certificate, M=Masters)
</ul>
Each registrant making a payment is enrolled in just one DCM program.
That DCM program and its <i>end</i> date are used to determine
digits 2-6 above.  Note that digit 5 could be a letter (X-Z)
and digit 6 is not a digit (0-9) at all but D, C, or M.
<p>
<i>Anyone</i> can register for an MMI <i>course</i> - even people who
are not enrolled in a DCM program.  These are called "auditors".
When auditors make a payment (via "New" MMI Payment) 
the values in digits 2-6 are determined using the MMI <i>course</i> itself.
Digit 6 is not D, C, or M but it is the <i>ordinal number</i> of the
course within its month.   e.g. It will be 2 if it is the
second MMI course within the month of its <i>end</i> date.
<p>
The program where you clicked on the "New" link will
be remembered with the payment itself.  This means you could
make a tuition payment on a course registration.  This raises
the question - are all tuition payments really attached
to the DCM program?  Auditors would pay a tuition I presume, yes?
They have no DCM program.  Hmmm.  How did old reg handle this?
<h3>List of MMI Payments</h3>
On an MMI program registration there is a link named "List"
for displaying all of a person's MMI payments.   On the Person
screen the link is "MMI Payments".
<p>
These fields are listed from the payment records:
<ul>      
<li>amount
<li>description
<li>date
<li>payment type
<li>program name
<li>note (optional)
</ul>
You can optionally show the GL number as well, if you wish,
with the link "Show GL".
<p>
Note that the program where a payment was made
was not recorded before Reg began to be used.
<h3>Calendar and DailyPic</h3>
DCM Programs (and Personal Retreats) are not shown on the
calendar (or the daily pic) as they would be annoyingly and
uselessly ever-present.
<h3>The MMI Admin</h3>
Within Reg there is a role called 'mmi_admin'.
Only users with this role can <i>see</i>
MMI registrations or payments or modify MMI programs.
Normal program admins/staff can see the programs but not modify them.
They can see the names of the registrants but not the actual
registration.  This is enforced via <i>whatever way</i> you might try to get
to the payments or registration or program.  A few examples:
<ul>
<li>The MMI payments are viewable via the person record
  of a person who is enrolled in an MMI program/course.
<li>Clicking on an MMI person's room in the DailyPic
  or the ClusterView will show you their name but
  not allow you to click through to their
  registration - unless one of your roles is mmi_admin.
<li>Asking for the Early/Late registrations list from
  a program screen.  You'll see different things depending
  on your role.
<li>In the Listings area there will be a link to create MMI Deposits.
    These are all MMI Payments made since the last time
    an MMI Deposit was made.  These deposits are separate from
    the MMC program/rental deposits.
</ul>
