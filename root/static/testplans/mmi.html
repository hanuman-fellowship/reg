For programs offered by Mount Madonna Institute (henceforward MMI)
the 'sponsoring organization' of the program is not MMC.
    It is either:
        MMI College of Ayurvda
        MMI School of Professional Massage
        MMI School of Yoga
        MMI School of Community Studies
You then need to specify a level:
    Diploma
    Certificate
    Masters
    Course
If it is not a Course then it is refered to as a DCM program.
MMI Courses/DCMs are marked with a red star in the list of programs.

Actually, to see current Personal Retreats and DCMs you must
    choose "PR/DCM" on the list progs page OR
    do a search for a program with a pattern (or season/year).
    These are not normally included because they are
    ever-present (or present for months at a time unlike
    most programs that are typically just a weekend)
    and become a kind of noise.

MMI Programs, at this time, do not have web pages - and hence
    no on-line registration.  People have to actually _apply_ to
    be a student of the Institute - just like any accredited school.
    Application forms _are_ available at the MMI web site.

    Since MMI Programs have no web page be sure that the
    "Web Ready" is NOT checked when creating/updating the program.

Registrations for a MMI _course_ are facilitated by the "Import"
    link on the course Program page.  You are presented with 
    the DCM programs that are concurrent with the course date range.
    You choose one or more DCM programs and everyone in
    these programs is registered for the course.  The housing
    type choice is assigned individually - based on the most recent
    housing type they were assigned.  If the DCM course is in winter,
    tenting choices are avoided.  Double is the default type.
    The housing type is set but the registrar still needs to go through
    and house everyone individually.

People can register for only one DCM program at a time.
    Such second registrations are prohibited.  When viewing
    a registration in an MMI _course_ there is a link "To DCM"
    with which you can jump to their DCM registration.

Tuition for DCM Programs is quite flexible depending on
    their ability to pay.  Various creative discounts for payment
    in full, etc.  So ... we don't really record the tuition _charges_.
    The comment field in the DCM program registration screen
    is used extensively to detail the payment arrangements that
    have been made.

MMI Payments
    We DO keep close track of the _payments_.  All MMI Payments
    are linked directly to the person not to the registrations.
    On any MMI program registration screen there
    is a section at the bottom named "MMI Payments" with
    links "New" and "List".
    
    Choosing "New" to create a new MMI payment
    you supply a dollar amount, type (credit/check/cash), what the payment
    is for (Tuition/Meals&Lodging/Fees/...) and an optional note.

    For general ledger accounting purposes MMI Programs
    do not really have a single GL number.  Each MMI payment has its _own_
    6 digit GL number which is automatically computed thusly:

        digit 1 - what for (1=Tuition, 2=Meals & Lodging, 3=Application Fee,
                            4=Registration Fee, 5=Other)
        digit 2 - school (1=Ayurveda, 2=Massage, 3=Yoga, 4=Community)
        digit 3 - tens digit of year
        digit 4 - units digit of year
        digit 5 - month (1=Jan, ...  9=Sep, X=Oct, Y=Nov, Z=Dec)
        digit 6 - level (D=Diploma, C=Certificate, M=Masters)

    Each registrant making a payment is enrolled in just one DCM program.
    That DCM program and its _end_ date are used to determine
    digits 2-6 above.  Note that digit 5 could be a letter (X-Z)
    and digit 6 is not a digit (0-9) at all but D, C, or M.

    *Anyone* can register for a MMI _course_ - even people who
    are not enrolled in a DCM program.  These are called "auditors".
    When auditors make a payment (via "New" MMI Payment) 
    the values in digits 2-6 are determined using the MMI _course_ itself.
    Digit 6 is not D, C, or M but it is the _ordinal number_ of the
    course within its month.   e.g. It will be 2 if it is the
    second MMI course within the month of its _end_ date.

    The program where you clicked on the "New" link will
    be remembered with the payment itself.  This means you could
    make a tuition payment on a course registration.  This raises
    the question - are all tuition payments really attached
    to the DCM program?  Auditors would pay a tuition I presume, yes?
    And they have no DCM program.

List of MMI Payments
    On an MMI program registration there is a link named "List"
    for displaying all of a person's MMI payments.   On the Person
    screen the link is "MMI Payments".

    These fields are listed from the payment records:
        
        amount, description, date, payment type,
        program name, and an optional note.

    You can optionally show the GL number as well, if you wish,
    with the link "Show GL".

    Note that the program where a payment was made
    was not recorded before newReg began to be used.

Calendar and DailyPic
    DCM Programs (and Personal Retreats) are not shown on the
    calendar (or the daily pic) as they would be annoyingly and
    uselessly ever-present.

There is a role 'mmi_admin'.  Only users with this role can _see_
    MMI registrations or payments or modify MMI programs.
    Normal program admins/staff can see the programs but not modify them.
    They can see the names of the registrants but not the actual
    registration.  This is enforced via _whatever way_ you might try to get
    to the payments or registration or program.  A few examples:

    - The MMI payments are viewable via the person record
      of a person who is enrolled in an MMI program/course.

    - Clicking on an MMI person's room in the DailyPic
      or the ClusterView will show you their name but
      not allow you to click through to their
      registration - unless one of your roles is mmi_admin.

    - Asking for the Early/Late registrations list from
      a program screen.  You'll see different things depending
      on your role.

    - In the Listings area there will be a link to create MMI Deposits.
        These are all MMI Payments made since the last time
        an MMI Deposit was made.  These deposits are separate from
        the MMC program/rental deposits.
