<h2>Summaries</h2>
Rentals and Programs both have Summaries with the same fields.
<p>
Summaries contains all kinds of specific information about the events.
They detail how MMC can be a gracious and attentive and generous host.
We are not just a hotel.
<p>
You access the summary with a link on the event's screen (to right of 
the start/end dates)
and from the summary you can go back to the event.
From the lists of programs and rentals you can go directly
to the summary if you want.
<p>
At the top of the summary you see various fields from
the event itself - like start/end dates and times, meeting places,
leaders/coordinators and their contact information.
These things cannot be changed while editing the summary.
You must go to the event screen or the person screen to do this.
<p>
The fields in a summary are of two types: one line and many line.
The one line fields all come together at the top.
If a one line field contains a question mark (?) or the string
'TBD' then it will be shown on the summary with a yellow highlighted
background.  This is to alert you to the fact that it needs
to be updated.
<p>
There are programs named 'MMC Template' and 'MMI Template'.
The summaries for these programs are used as a boiler-plate/template
for any new program or rental.  If the program is sponsored by MMI
then it uses the MMI Template otherwise the MMC one is used.
You can edit the summaries for the Template programs whenever
you wish and any <i>future</i> programs/rentals will use them.
You can also <i>replace</i> an existing summary with the template
by choosing the link 'Use Template' at the top of the Summary screen.
<p>
These templates ensure a certain consistency.
It is also much easier to delete things that don't apply
than to re-enter the same text over and over again.
<p>
There are 3 listings for the field staff named 'Set Up', 'Flower',
and 'Sound Setup'.  By clicking on the name you will see
the report from today through a month from today.
You can also specify your own custom date range.
These reports extract information from the summaries of programs
and rentals within the date range.
The 'Set Up' report shows both the 'Signage' and the 'Field Staff Set Up'
fields from the summaries.
<p>
For the kitchen listings the 'Food Service' field in the summaries
is shown at the bottom of the listings.
<p>
In all these listings the name of the rental or program
is a link with which you can go to its summary.
<p>
When a program or rental returns we Duplicate the event.
The summary is automatically duplicated as well.
This preserves all the information
about a group's specific needs and also their peculiar idiosyncracies.
It ensures that we will not forget the past.
