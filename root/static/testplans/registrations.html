Can register online in /staging2 programs that we
    have generated.  They're gotten every 5 minutes.
    Or you can click on a link to get them now.
"Online (3)" shown when programs are listed.
    Where else should it be?
See all online registrations with program and postmark date/time.
Click on name - registration form is shown.

the above needs updating

When all registrations in a program are shown the focus goes to
    a search text box.   If you see a registration (perhaps after scrolling)
    that you want you can click either on the name (last, first)
    to view the registration or you can click on the balance
    to pay it off.   You can also type in the search field
    and the list below will be narrowed according to
    a prefix of the last name (case insensitively).
    If you put "ash ri" (space separated two part search pattern)
    then the 'ash' will be matched as a prefix of the last name
    and the 'ri' will match the first name (as in searches in People).
    When the narrowed list is only one name long the whole row will
    become larger and red - indicating that it is the only one left.
    At this point you can hit Return and you will either view
    the registration OR will bring up the screen to pay the balance.
    Which is done depends on the date of the program, the date of
    the person's arrival (if they're coming early) and how
    this relates to the current date.
    It also depends on whether the balance is zero or not.
    dearReg tries to do what you would want.
    No sense in paying off a zero balance, huh?
    And if the person is arriving today they probably want
    to pay their balance.
