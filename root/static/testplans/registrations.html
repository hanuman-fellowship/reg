Registrations

After publishing the web page for a program you can
register online in /staging2.
    These registrations gotten every 5 minutes.
    Or you can click on a link (Grab New) to get them _now_.

"Online (3)" shown when programs are listed.
    Where else should it be?
    Choosing this shows all online registrations with person name,
    program name, and postmark date/time.
    Click on name and the registration form is shown.
    Fill in the various attributes and submit the form.
    A registration is created - along with Charge, Payment
    and History records.  Verify that the charges are correct.
    There are many possible discounts and charges:
        
        membership discounts
        lodging discounts for programs > 7 or 30 days
        kids pay half price for lodging
        credit from a prior cancellation
        ceu certificate

When viewing a completed registration there are lots
    of little blue i's on the screen.  Click on them
    to see a small popup window of who did it and when.
    Payments also show the receipt number.

If a person has the affiliation of "Pop Up Comment"
    then the comment on their person page will be shown
    whenever they first register.

Editing a registration and changing the attributes
    will recompute the charges - and undo/redo any membership
    benefits that were possibly taken.

For non-online registrations - sent in by letter or taken
    over the phone - you first find (or create) the person
    record and then click on "Register".   This brings up
    a form containing a place for the deposit amount
    and a postmark date.   AND the list of _future_ programs.
    Choose one of these and submit the form and you will
    come to the same registration form as with online registrations.
    Continue as usual by filling in the rest of the fields.

Confirmation Letters

    After a registration is completed, a link "Send Conf" at the top
    will be in red and larger than the other links.   Clicking it will send
    a detailed confirmation letter to the person's email address.
    If the registrant does not have an email address
    the letter will shown in the browser window so it can be printed.

    After this the "Send Conf" link will be changed to "ReSend Conf".

    If you have sent several confirmation letter with
    different confirmation "notes", then there will be
    a link to click on (near the confirmation note field)
    that will show the history of such notes.

Cancellations
    
    One can cancel a registration - after a confirming step.
    You are asked whether or not the person should get a credit
    and how much.   The relevant cancellation policy is shown
    on this screen.  A history record of the cancellation
    is shown on the registration.   Any membership benefits taken
    will be returned.

Listing of Registrations
========================
On a program screen there's a link 'Registrations'
    which shows a list of all the people registered
    for that program (including a count at the top).  The focus goes to
    a search text box.   If you see a registration (perhaps after scrolling)
    that you want you can click either on the name (last, first)
    to view the registration or you can click on the balance
    to pay it off.   You can also type in the search field
    and the list below will be narrowed according to
    a prefix of the last name (case insensitively).
    If you put "ash ri" (space separated two part search pattern)
    then the 'ash' will be matched as a prefix of the last name
    and the 'ri' will match the first name (as in searches in People).
    When the narrowed list is only one name long the whole row will
    become larger and red - indicating that it is the only one left.
    At this point you can hit Return and you will either view
    the registration OR will bring up the screen to pay the balance.
    Which is done depends on the date of the program, the date of
    the person's arrival (if they're coming early) and how
    this relates to the current date.
    It also depends on whether the balance is zero or not.
    dearReg tries to do what you would want.
    No sense in paying off a zero balance, huh?
    And if the person is arriving today they probably want
    to pay their balance.

On the list of registrations for a program
a red letter might prefix each line as follows:

    X - cancelled
    L - confirmation letter has not been sent
    H - needs housing
