    attitude of "come here... sit down and I'll explain it to you".
    humor is always welcome and always helps - perhaps in footnotes or
        as an addendum if it might get in the way...
    documents written by engineers are often lousy
    she can use my cms_mmc.html as a secondary reference
        the program itself as the first.
    make it an HTML document accessible from the program directly 
        use a simple style - content matters most
        Jamal can help 'fancy it up' if needed.
        just use these basic tags to organize the document:
            h1, h2, etc
            p
            br
            ol or ul
            li
            b
            i
            u
            img src=        (for screen shots)
            a href=         (for links)
    perhaps a task oriented format in one chapter?
        how do I do such and such a task?
    in the end - she should write the kind of document
        that she would want to read
if overwhelmed by complexity
    not so complex yet - sans registration and sans housing!

testing
    feedback!  her own or what she gathers/overhears in the office.
    not a whitewash, please!
    even trivial things.
    a successful test is a failure!
    alternate UI suggestions if nothing else and these never end...
    realistic testing is quite useful - but not always
        one good test would be to input 2 or 3 real programs
        and take a look at the generated web pages and verify
        that they look just like the ones generated by the old reg.

        mostly you should do 'minimalistic focused testing'.
        this means putting just a few characters in each required
        fields - no need to put actual names or normal looking addresses.
