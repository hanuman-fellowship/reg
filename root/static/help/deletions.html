DELETIONS
=========

All the different categories of information
(Programs, People, Cancellation Policies, etc)
have a way to delete the items.  Deletions can
be dangerous so there are two things to prevent disaster:

- There will always be an Alert dialog to confirm the deletion.

- In some cases a Delete is prohibited if it would leave things in a
    confused state.  Note these cases:

    o Deleting people who are Members or Leaders is prohibited.
        You first need to delete their leadership or membership.
    o Only the super admin can delete a Member.
    o Deleting a Leader will first show you the programs they are leading,
        if any.  The program names are links by which you can
        go see that program attributes.
        There is this secondary confirmation dialog because if
        the leader is deleted it may leave a program without a leader.
    o Deleting Affiliations will first show you
        where the affiliation is used in People, Programs and Reports.
        There is, again, a secondary confirmation dialog.
        The affiliation will disappear from the People, Program and Reports.
        Verify this.
    o Cancellation Policies and Housing Costs named "Default"
        cannot be deleted.
    o Deleting a Cancellation Policy that is used in a program
        is prohibited.  Same for Housing Cost.  Verify this.
    o Deleting a template used in a program is prohibited.
        The template named 'template' is the default and
        cannot be deleted at all.
    o Strings and Roles cannot be deleted at all.
    o Deleting a program will also delete a FULL version, if any.
