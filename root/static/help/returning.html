<h2>Returning Programs/Rentals</h2>
Gladly many programs and rentals return to rent and present again.
This is undoubtably because they have had a positive experience
and want to repeat it.
<p>
newReg provides various facilities to accomodate such returnees.
The aim is to accurately preserve whatever useful information we
already have on these groups and also to eliminate a burdensome
clerical need to re-enter it all.
<p>
You can 'Duplicate' rentals and programs.
Many things are the same as before but
you will need to enter new dates, of course.
You also need to indicate what days will have lunches.
A different GL number will be generated.
<p>
The summary will be duplicated exactly - it has all kinds
of specific requests and needs unique to the group.
<p>
Meeting places need to be reassigned and
for rentals you need to indicate anew what the housing needs are.

<h3>MMC Does Registration and Parallel Programs</h3>
If a rental has 'MMC Does Registration' checked then
after the rental is duplicated you will be presented
with a program creation screen to create its parallel program.
<h3>Proposals</h3>
A returning Rental will likely already have an existing Proposal.<br>
Proposals can also be duplicated but this situation needs
to be handled in a special way.
<p>
Note: This is complex and tricky so wake up!
<p>
This is the recommended order:
<ol>
<li>Duplicate the Proposal giving this new information:
<ul>
<li>Date of Call
<li>Dates Requested
<li>Program Meeting Date
</ul>
<li>At the program staff meeting decide the fate of this returning rental.
<li>If denied, simply check 'Denied' (and transmit the contact person).
<li>If approved, do <span help="color: red">not</span> click Approved.
Do this instead:
<ol type=a>
<li>On the <i>original</i> proposal click 'To Rental' to find the
original rental.
<li>Duplicate <i>this</i> original past rental specifying new dates.
<li>While viewing the duplicated new rental click 'Link Proposal'.<br>
This will link the duplicated rental to the duplicated proposal.
</ol>
</ol>
