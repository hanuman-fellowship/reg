The attendance field is for special cases
where some people have not attended the rental the
entire time.  For example: Let's assume a rental
runs for 6 days.  If you put this in the Attendance field in the Double row:
<ul>
1x4, 3x2
</ul>
it means that 1 person staying in a Double only came for 4 days
and 3 others stayed for just 2 days.
<p>
Children pay half of the normal room cost.  2 children staying for
3 days would be denoted like this:
<ul>
2cx3
</ul>
<p>
This information is used in the housing calculation of the invoice.
If the attendance field is blank it is assumed that the '# of People'
field represents people who have stayed the entire program.
<p>
Note that the rooms that have been reserved for the rental
will not be able to be used by anyone else <b>during the entire
6 days</b> regardless of whether anyone is in them or not.
Furthermore, the rooms will not be made-up until the Rental
has finished completely.
