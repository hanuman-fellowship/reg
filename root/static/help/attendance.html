<title>Rental Attendance</title>
</head>
<body>
The attendance fields are used for housing cost calculations in the invoice.
It is here where you indicate how many people
stayed in what kind of housing for how many days.
<p>
For example: Let's assume a rental runs for 6 days.
4 people stayed in Singles for the entire 6 days so
in the Single field you would put:
<ul>
4x6
</ul>
Some people did not attend the rental the entire time.
If you put this in the Attendance field in the Double row:
<ul>
1x4, 3x2
</ul>
it means that 1 person staying in a Double only came for 4 days
and 3 others stayed for just 2 days.
<p>
Children pay half of the normal room cost.  2 children staying for
3 days would be denoted like this:
<ul>
2cx3
</ul>
<p>
Note that the rooms that have been reserved for the rental
will not be able to be used by anyone else <b>during the entire
6 days</b> regardless of whether anyone is in them or not.
Furthermore, the rooms will not be made-up until the Rental
has finished completely.
