The attendance field is for special cases
where some people have not attended the rental the
entire time.  For example: Let's assume a rental
runs for 6 days.  If you put this in the Double row for Attendance:
<ul>
1x4, 3x2
</ul>
it means that 1 person staying in a Double only came for 4 days
and 3 others stayed for just 2 days.
<p>
This information will be used in the calculations of finances.
<p>
Note that the rooms that have been reserved for the rental
will not be able to be used by anyone else <b>during the entire
6 days</b> regardless of whether anyone is in them or not.
Furthermore, the rooms will not be made-up until the Rental
has finished completely.
