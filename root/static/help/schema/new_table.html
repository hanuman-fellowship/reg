<h2>Adding a New Table
<span class=to_schema><a href=index.html>To Schema</a></span>
</h2>
For demonstration purposes, let's add a new tabled called 'activity'
<ol>
  <li>From the $HOME/lib/RetreatcenterDB/.. find an existing Resultsource class
    that is similar to your new table and copy it.
  <pre class=code>
    cp $HOME/lib/RetreatcenterDB/Glossary.pm \
    $HOME/lib/RetreatcenterDB/Activity.pm 
  </pre>
  <li>Open the new resultsource and edit it to reflect the new table design.  Be
    sure to edit the package name as well as update the column documentation at
    the end of the file since gendoc will use it to create documentation.  Be sure
    that the file name and the package name properly match (this is a common error)
  <li>Edit $HOME/RetreatcenterDB.pm to add the name of your new class to the 'classes'
    list.
  <li>Create new table SQL in $HOME/sql/.. (remember to follow the ordered naming 
    convention).  Be sure to teset your new SQL and inform other developers as needed.
  <li>Run checkdoc
  <pre class=code>
  cd $HOME/lib/RetreatcenterDB
  ./checkdoc
  </pre>
  <li>If checkdoc passes next run gendoc and the remebr to commit all your changes
  <pre class=code>
  ./gendoc
  </pre>
</ol>
