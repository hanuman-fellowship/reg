<h2>Catalyst - URL Dispatch
<span class=to_schema><a href=/static/help/schema/index.html>To Schema</a></span>
</h2>
Reg uses a Perl module named 'Catalyst' to help organize the code.
It implements an MVC design pattern - MVC stands for Model/View/Controller.
One main thing Catalyst does is take a URL and converts it to
a method call in a particular class.  This is called 'dispatch'.
<p>
The so-called "Controller" classes all live in Reg/lib/RetreatCenter/Controller
and are derived from the parent class Catalyst::Controller.
<p>
In the source tree is a very simple Controller class only for the
purpose of demonstration.  It is called Hello.pm and looks like this:

<pre style="margin-left: 10mm">
use strict;
use warnings;
package RetreatCenter::Controller::Hello;
use base 'Catalyst::Controller';

use lib '../../';       # so you can do a perl -c here.
use Util qw/
    model
    stash
/;

sub index : Local {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;

    $c->forward('demo');
}

sub demo : Local {
    my ($self, $c, $name, $i) = @_;

    $name ||= 'Sahadev';
    $i ||= 42;
    stash($c,
        template => 'hello/demo.tt2',
        number   => $i,
        name     => $name,
    );
}

1;
</pre>
The index method is what is called with the URL:
<pre style="margin-left: 10mm">
    kali:3000/hello
</pre>
<p>
It forwards control on to 'demo'.
<p>
This URL:
<pre style="margin-left: 10mm">
    kali:3000/hello/demo/Charles/28
</pre>
goes directly to the 'demo' method in Hello.pm and passes along
the 'Charles' and the 28 as parameters to that method (see $name and $i above).
Preceding these two parameters you will always have
$self and $c.   $c is the "catalyst context" and is
used in several places.   Note also the ': Local'.  This is needed
for Catalyst to be able to dispatch URLs to it.   There are other things
that one can give aside from 'Local' but these are not used in Reg.
<p class=p2>
In the demo method you see the utility subroutines 'model' and 'stash' (from
Reg/lib/Util.pm and exported from there into Hello.pm).
stash() is used to create the screen output of the 'demo' method.
You first give it $c.   Then a hash of values.  One key of the hash
must be 'template' - the value of which is a pathname to a 'Template Toolkit' file
with a .tt2 suffix.  The pathname begins at Reg/root/src/ - this is where
the "Views" live.   The other parameters to stash() are passed along to
the template.   Here's what a template would look like - the 'hello/demo.tt2' file:
