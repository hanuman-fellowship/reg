You can control which months are displayed in the calendar
as well as whether you see the details and/or the images.
<p>
Images and Details - Images are shown by default; Details are not.
<p>
Start and End - These date fields set the first and last months you see.
Dates can be entered in a variety of numeric formats:
<ul>
1/4/2009<br>
100309<br>
20080301<p>
or just the month/year:<p>
3/11<br>
5 10
</ul>
The End date can also be a single number which is how many
months you wish to see.
<p>
If the start date is blank it will default to today.
If the end date is blank it defaults to the last month
in which there is a scheduled event.
<p>
To show the new calendar you can click "Go" or 
(more easily) hit Return in the Start or End field.
<p>
The top line of input fields
will not be included when printing the screen.
If you include images each month will be put on a separate page.
<p>
The numbers in blue at the bottom of the month are the number
of people who are present for personal retreats.  You can click on the
number to see who the people are.  The numbers in green are the
'total guest population' counts for the day.
