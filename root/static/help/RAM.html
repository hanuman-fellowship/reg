New House: RAM 1 Cottage<br>
This is a *single occupancy* place.<br>
They have the entire house to themselves.
<p>
Obviously, if someone chooses this no one else can have a single or double
in RAM 1A or RAM 1B.
<p>
5 new housing types:
<p>
Whole Cottage<br>
Single Cottage 1<br>
Double Cottage 1<br>
Single Cottage 2<br>
Double Cottage 2
<p>
Only the RAM houses are termed 'cottages'
<p>
Someone needs to fill in the costs in the various HouseCosts in the future
they are otherwise zero which means not available.
For testing I added the costs from this spreadsheet:
<p>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16bSwoJfd_BPhJRsOMqrxtwBCCWIJ4V3_MGal6NM35eg/edit#gid=0
<p>
to the Housing Cost named 'FY23 Rental w/ Lunch 2022-23'
<p>
For Programs:
<p>
if you lodge someone in whole RAM 1 cottage<br>
then single, double in RAM1A and RAM1B are blocked<br>
if you lodge someone in any of RAM 1A or RAM 1B single or double<br>
then whole RAM 1 cottage is blocked<br>
If the room is vacated these blocks are UNdone 
<p>
Adding Rental and Program Multiple Blocks<br>
Rental Mass Delete - Blocks & Booking - <br>
Rental and Program Cluster Reservations<br>
All RAM rooms are *included* - reserving/blocking a room is not the same as actually booking the room. . .
<p>
Adding the RAM cluster to a Rental - RAM 1A is a Double Cottage 1
not a Single Cottage 1 - although it could be resized...
this idea also applies to the CC double rooms
<p>
Reserving an entire Cluster for a program or rental is a way of preventing
other programs/rentals from getting access to it.
This has been a source of confusion about whether the rooms are
available or not - because it does not show prominently
on the DailyPic or ClusterView - it IS at the bottom.
<p>
Rental Contract - new and old do show the proper housing options
<p>
Rental Grid
you get an error if you put someone in both RAM 1A/B and RAM 1 Cottage
