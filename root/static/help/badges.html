<h2>Badges</h2>
<p>
Badges are used for a variety of purposes:
<ul>
<li>As a name tag.
<li>To give important information like the emergency number and the gate code.
<li>At the front of the meal line the badges are checked to verify someone has paid for meals.
<li>To remind the person which room they're in.
</ul>
<p>
You print the badges two-sided in color, cut them up with a paper cutter,
and insert them into plastic sleeves with lanyards.
After the badges are printed you can Close the window with the badges.
<p>
Badges can be printed from several places:
<ul>
<li>The Listings page - to print badges for PRs and Special Guests.
<li>A Rental page
<li>The AllRegs page for Programs
<li>An individual Registration page
<li>Custom badges: see Configuration > Badge
</ul>
<p>
Since Personal Retreats (and Special Guests) programs have a variety of
arrival dates you cannot print badges from the AllRegs page of these 'programs'.
<p>
Badges require that the program or rental have a gate code in the Summary.
They also require that the Badge Title or Title (in the Web tab) - be no
more than 30 characters in length.
If any of these things are not present the generation of badges
will be aborted.
