<h2>Hanuman Fellowship Memberships</h2>
Memberships can only be maintained by 
a user with the role of Member Admin.
They have total control over a person's status.
<p>
After finding a person (through the normal search method)
and viewing them, you can say "Make Member".
You fill in what kind of membership (General/Sponsor)
and a date.   On hitting submit you'll see a screen
summarizing that person's member info.
<p>
Clicking on "Members" at the top you'll see the person in the list.
And when viewing the person's main screen you will see "Member Info".
<p>
Only the Super Admin role can delete a member and their payment history.
<p>
General memberships have an expiration date.
<p>
Sponsor memberships have:
<ul>
<li>A payment due date after which their benefits expire.
<li>A number of nights free lodging.
</ul>
A general member becomes a 'lapsed general member' when
    their expiration date passes.
<p>
On the Members screen the link "By Category" will generate
a printable list of members in the 3 categories with counts.
People with asterisks are people whose membership has lapsed.
<p>
Sponsoring members pay more regularily than General members
(and get further benefits thereby).  We keep track of their payments
in a history list (displayed below the member info).  
Clicking on 'Edit/Delete' allows you to modify the payments
when you make a mistake.
<p>
There is also a history of actions that have taken place
with respect to the free nights and free program.
Click on the little 'i' to see who did it and when.
<p>
When an individual has paid a total of $5,000 they can
become a Life member.  If a partnered couple has jointly paid
$8,000 they both become Life members.
Life members get even more benefits.
The transition to Life membership is not handled automatically.
It is a rare event so this should not be a burden.
<p>
Life members have one free program each year.
<p>
The link "Reset Nights" is clicked on once a year (Dec 31st)
and will reset everyone's nights back to 12. Life members
will get their free program reset as well.   Since this is a
drastic thing to do there's a separate confirmation page
with a secret password (sita - don't tell ANYone).
<p>
The links "Lapsed" and "Lapse in One Month" will show
the list of such people and allow the sending of
an individualized email reminder.   On sending, the number of
emails sent is shown followed by the names and addresses
of members that do not have email.  You can click on these
names to print their letter.
<p>
There are several other things on the Membership page
to be documented at a later time.
