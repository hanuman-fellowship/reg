<h2>Clusters</h2>
Rooms (this term includes tent sites) are grouped into
clusters - mostly by geographic contiguity.  For example, the
cluster named 'CC 1st' consists of all the rooms on the first floor
of the CC.  The cluster 'Madrone Own Tent' is all the tent sites
in the Madrone Campground where people can set up their own tents.
The 'Miscellaneous' cluster contains KKWC, OH MAIN, and LTL HSE among others.
<p>
The DailyPic is the best way to see which rooms are in each cluster.
<p>
The ClusterView is a two-week view of how the rooms
in a cluster are populated.
<h3>Rentals</h3>
An entire cluster can be reserved for a Rental.
On the 'Meals/Lodging' tab there is a link 'Cluster Reservations'
which brings you to a list of Available and Reserved clusters.
When you click on an Available cluster name all the rooms in the
cluster will be assigned to the appropriate housing type.
When you click on a Reserved cluster
all of its rooms will be removed from the Rental's assigned list
and returned to the unbooked pool.
<p>
For a cluster to be in the Available list
all of its rooms must be <i>entirely
unoccupied</i> for the duration of the Rental.
Once you have reserved a cluster for a Rental you <i>can</i> remove
rooms individually.  The cluster is <i>still</i> reserved for the Rental
and is not available to other Rentals in the same time period.
<p>
If two Rentals do not have any overlapping days they can
both reserve the same cluster.  Note that if one Rental begins on the day
that another ends they do not overlap.
<p>
On both the DailyPic and the ClusterView rooms will be marked
with an 'R' if they are reserved for a Rental.  Clicking on the R
will popup a window with the Rental name and housing type.
You can click on the name to go to the Rental itself.
<h3>Programs</h3>
Clusters can also be reserved for Programs.
On the bottom of the 'Meals/Lodging' tab there are, again,
two lists of clusters - Available and Reserved.
For a cluster to be included in the Available list it must
not be reserved for any other overlapping Rental or Program.
It does not need to be entirely unoccupied.
<p>
Similarily, if a cluster is reserved for a Program it will not be included
in the Available list of any overlapping Rental.  The word
'reserved' has its usual meaning here.
<h3>Registrations</h3>
When looking for a room for a Registration in a given Program
<i>all</i> clusters will be searched - <i>except</i> those that have
been reserved for <i>other</i> overlapping Programs or Rentals.  The list of
rooms that is presented is sorted based on various factors - resize needed,
cabin, foreign program, already occupied, the priority of the room.
Houses in a cluster that has been reserved for the Program will be
given extra weight in the sort - thus bringing them nearer to the top.
<p>
The final little nerdy note (which borders on the opaquely obscure):
When doing housing for Personal Retreat registrations
we do not search clusters that have been reserved
for Programs and Rentals that overlap with
<i>the registration itself</i> rather than those that overlap
with the entire Personal Retreat program.  Phew!
<h3>Blocks and FORCEs</h3>
Blocks do not respect the above described reserved cluster mechanisms.
Similarily, rooms in an otherwise reserved cluster <i>can</i> be used
when you FORCE their use in a registration housing dialog.
In these (hopefully rare) circumstances the user is taking
responsibility for the consequences (mixed gender, mixed programs, etc)
of these overriding actions.
<h3>DailyPic, ClusterView, Calendar</h3>
In these graphical views of the Program and Rental data you will
see which clusters have been reserved for which Program/Rental.
<h3>Confusion</h3>
If after reserving some clusters for a Program
you change its start and/or end date 
those clusters may no longer be valid.
Either don't do this or be careful otherwise you will confuse yourself.
