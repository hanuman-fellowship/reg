<h2>What's the difference between a Cabin and a Room? </h2>
<b>Cabins</b> are in a lovely grove of oak trees and have electricity and heat, but no plumbing. A separate restroom with flush toilets and private shower rooms is nearby. The cabins are a 12-minute walk up the hill above the lake. If this
sounds too rustic for you, please consider asking for a room.

<b>Rooms</b> are
in hotel-style buildings (no phones or TVs in rooms, however). Some rooms
include a private bathroom with shower. Others have access to nearby
shared (but private while in use) bathrooms and showers.
