<h2>Going Live</h2>
In some rough order of importance:
<ol>
<li>Review the confirmation letter (and cancellation letter)
for help and accuracy.
<li>Transform the web description, leader biography, sums, etc
    into the little Word-help editor syntax.
    No more _, *, ~, - stuff.
    This is needed before we can publish and move staging to live again.
<li>Sahadev: Modify the program web page template to invoke reg1 instead
of dreg1.  Or nreg1?  Or leave it as dreg1?
Modify the configuration string staging2 to staging.
On www.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin move old scripts and templates aside
and put new in place instead.
Name them what?
<li>Assign meeting places for rentals/programs.
<li>Add housing clusters to programs.
<li>Complete the rental records - coordinator,
    max, deposit, lunches, housing, etc.
<li>Before publishing, UNcheck 'Web Ready' for all but the
next season's programs.  The ones beyond that are for future
planning's sake only not publication.
<li>Register and house leaders of programs if not already registered/housed.
<li>Check/modify the names of the directories for unlinked programs
    and then publish to web and verify.  This is a different process
    than in old reg.
<li>Cron jobs - start carpool going.
    After changing who the snail mail people email letters go to.
<li>Users can change their passwords from the default 'hello'.
<li>Add GL Numbers to MMI courses so that auditors' payments
can be given proper GL Numbers (The course GL Number prefixed by 1 or 2).
<li>Add the Driver role to the drivers - perhaps adding them
as Users if they aren't there already.
<li>Enter free nights & free program status for sponsor/life members.
Retire the box of index cards.
<li>Some MMI people are registered for more than one D/C/M program.
    We need to delete their registration(s) for the old one.
<li>Need to create the 'parallel' programs for 'MMC Does Registration' rentals.
Or connect up ones that are already there with registrations.
<li>Investigate which browser to use - IE, Firefox, Safari, etc.
Safari on Windows might handle opening new tabs better.
<li>We have many people in the mailing list now (again)
who have not contacted the center for years and years.
We can easily Mass Inactivate them - but we need to
determine after what date?
<li>Get high resolution pictures for leaders/programs.
It is a simple thing to send out a request Bcc'ing every leader, yes?
With the ubiquitousness of >5 megapixel cameras there
is no reason we can't get good images.
At a minimum take a picture when the leader comes here!
I suspect some would rather use the image of their younger selves
but that's silly, right? :)
<li>Have the program staff settle on colors for calendar, meeting places, etc.
<li>Also decide on dailypic chars for empty room, resize, etc etc.
I (Sahadev) like a dash for empty rooms - but I'm not a user.
<li>Undup - an ongoing large task.  Time to begin it in earnest.
Also reformatting the foreign addresses.
Perhaps hire someone to do this onerous clerical task?    
Perhaps someone likes doing this kind of detail oriented job.
<li>Remove unused old and unneeded Affiliations.
<li>It is likely not worth entering past proposals, right?
<li>Add any events - such as YSC, Ramayana, Babaji's comings/goings.
<li>Delete bogus rentals/programs - used for accounting purposes?
    like MISC, YTT 500, YTT 500 ADMIN.2, TRANSPORTATION
    SECLUSION, MEMBERSHIP, MOTHERING MAG
    dup'ed INFINITE SMILE rental, etc.
<li>Add anew reports for mailings.  They were not transferred
from old reg because there were so many crufty ones.
Time to rethink these.
<li>Re-enter summaries - using the templates.
    Copy, Paste & Verify.
    Enter programs named "MMI Template" and "MMC Template" with 
    some start, end dates, not web-ready.  Enter summary data for them.
    This will be used for the default summary for MMI and MMC programs/rentals.
<li>Past MMI payments need to be sorted out - following Brajesh's notes
    on the printout?
<li>Inform field staff about the various listings available to them.
<li>More items to be determined as we go along.
</ol>
<h2>Schedule of Going Live Events April 20-25</h2>
<ol>
<li>Monday, April 20th - 9:00 am
<p>
Sahadev stops making changes.  <i>All</i> test plans are run through
by Laura and Sahadev.  Any new issues discovered will be evaluated
to see if they are 'show stoppers' that need immediate fixing.
By the end of the day an assessment will be made of whether we proceed or not.
Assuming all is well (or well enough) ... tag the CVS source with release 1.0.
Sahadev stays overnight.
<li>Tuesday, April 21st - 9:00 am
<ol type=a>
<li>Disable online registration - informing users that maintenance is
happening and that they can come back to register on Wednesday morning.
Include the office phone number if there are any questions.
<li>Get any pending OOs into oldreg.
<li>Backup old reg data with normal backup script.
<li>Alert everyone that no further changes are to be made in old reg/mlist.
<li>Disable reg and mlist to ensure that no further changes can be made.
Or ... perhaps leave them available for read-only reference during the day.
Any inadvertent changes made will <i>not</i> be brought into newReg.
<li>Dump all data from old reg.
On kali be sure to properly preserve member, donation, and meeting place data.
Read the dumped oldreg data into newReg on kali.
<li>Begin the various tasks listed above that relate to publishing all of
the current season's programs.
Verify the staging area very carefully and then move web pages to live.
(Laura mostly but also Jayanti for MMC and Brajesh for calendar and MMI things).
<li>Restore online registration.
<li>Do a test registration from A to Z using a real credit card.
<li>Sahadev stays overnight.
</ol>
<li>Wednesday, April 22nd - 9:00 am
<p>
Continue monitoring online registrations carefully.
Continue the above tasks that are beyond publishing.
Like input of summaries, evaluating inactive, changing user passwords, etc.
<p>
As far as I can see that's it.  We have gone live and are using newReg.
Old Reg will still be there but will become increasingly irrelevant.
Eventually we will shut it down and retire the software and the machine.
There is nothing there that is not in newReg in a more accessible form.
