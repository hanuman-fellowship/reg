There will be a nicely formatted page that describes the entire Mountain Experience.
The fun things to do, what is allowed, what is not...
On it there's a link to do the registration.
<p>
This is the registration link:
https://mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/regME
<p>
It says meals are:
Lunch on Wednesday 12:30-1:30, Brunch on Saturday 10:00-11:00
Dinner 5:15-6:15<br>
Choose a date (Wed or Sat, See the excluded dates for ME), <br>
what meals do you want, yoga class?<br>
Then pay.<br>
This page is plain, not 'styled' like other pages but ... it works.<br>
Perhaps Jamal or Shantam can help style it to be similar to other pages on mountmadonna.org<br>
Or not.  The site IS being redone.
RetreatGuru (see esalen) does do a redirect to their RG site ...
and just have a logo to make it look 'official'
<p>
TODO: make the date selectable from a little calendar image
like it is done when registering for a PR.   This will
take some research.
<p>
Configuration > Strings<br>
mountain_experience_cost - 75<br>
This is a fixed cost regardless of which meals they want.<br>
There is also me_max - currently 20 - a maximum # of Mountain Experience
registrations per day.   This can be changed as the need
arises.   This is separate from pr_max - to limit the number
of PRs on a day.
<p>
?When are they 'allowed' to arrive?  And depart?<br>
This will be in the page before the registration
and in the confirmation letter...
<p>
?The documents 'Guest Packet' and 'Info Sheet' (sent in Arrangements letter)
disagree about dinner time on Saturday - Info Sheet says 5:00-6:00
<p>
These registrations 'live' in Personal Retreats
In AllRegs you see just ONE date and house type is 'Not Needed'
and House says 'Mountain Experience' - in green
<p>
Meals - Lunch (Brunch) and/or Dinner - this is a field in the Registration
shown when viewing - just below Program line<br>
it is consulted when generating the Meal List
<p>
On Saturday 'Lunch' means Brunch
<p>
In the Meal list with details it shows 'Mountain Experience' - in green
<p>
On the Calendar - the blue line at the bottom of each month
shows the PRs and MEs.  Clicking on it shows the people's names.
Mountain Experience registration names are shown with a green background
<p>
?Should the confirmation letter be adapted for these registrations?
Yes.  I await instructions from Lara.
<p>
Yoga Class? - it is put in the Comment field - after any special request they made.<br>
"They wish to attend a yoga class."<br>
or<br>
"They are not interested in a yoga class."
<p>
The listing 'Comings and Goings'
shows 'Mountain Experience' (in green)
and the comment (yoga class or not?)
<p>
Configuration > Date Ranges ME/PR<br>
a primitive interface because it is rarely used and only by trained experts
this syntax is checked:
<p>
ME 20220901-20220904 30<br>
PR 20221101-20221120 10
<p>
these supercede pr_max and me_max
to make a 'user-friendly' interface would take hours and hours
and be more fragile
