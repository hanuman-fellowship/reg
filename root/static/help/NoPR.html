Adding an Event with a date range the Name can contain:
<p>
No PR<br>
No PR indoor<br>
No Meal<br>
No Lunch<br>
No ME<br>
<br>
And combinations:<br>
<br>
No PR ME Meal indoor<br>
<br>
<br>
The key is the word 'No' surrounded by space (or the beginning of the line)
<p>
ME (mountain experience) is distinguished from Meal
<p>
ME end dates vs PR end dates<br>
PR end dates are -1 - yes<br>
<br>
Note that we ALSO have:<br>
<br>
Yes ME<br>
<br>
Both No ME and Yes ME interact with the String me_dow.
See cgi-bin/regME on mountmadonna.org
<br><br>
The words ME, PR, and Meal can be in mixed/lower case
and have an optional 's' afterwards. 
After these kind of Events are added values are updated
on mountmadonna.org.<br>
<br>
There are the Strings pr_max and me_max
AND Date Ranges ME/PR that supercede these.
