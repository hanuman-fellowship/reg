<br>
And combinations:<br>
<br>
No PR ME Meals indoors<br>
<br>
The key is the word 'no' surrounded by space (or the beginning of the line)
<p>
Me (mountain experience) is distinguished from Meals
<p>
ME end dates vs PR end dates<br>
PR end dates are -1 - yes<br>
<br>
After an Event is added it is checked and all values are updated on mountmadonna.org<br>
<br>
There are also the Strings pr_max and me_max AND now there are PR/ME Date Ranges that supercede these.
