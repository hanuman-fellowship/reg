<h2>Date Formats</h2>
Dates are much more complicated than we realize.
<p>
When specifying a new default_date_format in Configuration-Strings<br>
you can place a variety of format characters in the string.
As an example,
<ul>
%b %e '%y
</ul>
will display January 2nd, 2009 like so:
<ul>
Jan 2 '09
</ul>
The default default is:
<ul>
%D
</ul>
which displays thusly:
<ul>
        01/02/09
</ul>
So with this as an introduction here are the format characters
and their meanings:
<ul>
