<h2>MMI Online Registration</h2>
Some MMI Courses are made available to the <b>public</b>.
These courses are not just for
students who are working towards a formal Diploma, Certificate, or Masters accredited degree
from MMI.
These courses are advertised widely and there are web pages at mountmadonnainstitute.org
to allow <i>anyone</i> to register for the course online.
This document outlines the steps needed to make the above happen.
<ol>
<li>Define the stand alone course - its curriculum and its teacher.
<li>Create a program in Reg for this course - you specify (at least) these things:
<ul>
<li>Name
<li>Start and End dates
<li>Housing Cost (Meals/Lodging tab)
<li>On the Misc tab:
<ul>
<li>Category - Normal
<li>Sponsoring Organization - MMI
<li>Level - Stand Alone Course (non DCM)
</ul>
<li>Tuition (Finance tab)
<li>Title (Web tab)
<li>Check 'Web Ready' (Web tab)
</ul>
<li>At mountmadonnainstitute.org create a web page that describes
the course completely.  To make it easy to find, make links to this page
from various places on the site.   Somewhere on the course web page there should be
a 'Register Here' link like so:
<pre>
    <a href=#>&gt;Register Here</a>
    
    Here is the HTML for the link:

    &lt;a href=<span style="color: purple">http://www.mountmadonnainstitute.org/cgi-bin/reg1?dir=courses&id=<span style="color: red">3661</span></span>&gt;&amp;gt;Register Here&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The <span style="color: purple">purple</span> href above is the same for all stand alone courses.
The <span style="color: red">red</span> 3661 above is the ID of the course's program in Reg.
<p>
How to easily get the program ID and the href?   See the next step.
<li>When looking at the Programs in Reg you will see the command "MMI Publish".  When you
choose it, Reg will gather all future MMI stand alone programs and 'publish' them
on the mountmadonnainstitute.org site.  In this context, 'publish' means that
information is made available to that site to facilitate online registration.  It does
not alter any web pages on the site.  You will see a summary page like this:
