<h2>MMI Programs</h2>
For programs offered by Mount Madonna Institute (henceforward MMI)
the 'Sponsoring Organization' of the program is not MMC.
It is one of these:
<ul>
<li>MMI School of Yoga
<li>MMI College of Ayurveda
<li>MMI School of Professional Massage
<li>MMI School of Community Studies
</ul>
You then need to specify a 'Level':
<ul>
<li>Course
<li>Public Course
<li>CS YSC1
<li>CS YSC2
<li>CS YSL1
<li>CS YSL2
<li>YTT 200M
<li>YTT 200S
<li>YTT 300
<li>AHC
<li>CAP
<li>Masters
</ul>
If it is not a Course then it is refered to as a 'Credentialed' program.
MMI Courses and Credentialed Programs are marked with 'MMI' in the list of programs.
<p>
Actually, to see the Credentialed programs you must
choose 'Credentialed' on the program list page OR
do a search for a program with a pattern (or season/year).
These are not normally included because they are
ever-present (or present for months at a time unlike
most programs that are typically just a weekend)
and become a kind of noise.  Note also that these
special programs do not allow the specifying of lunch days.
<p>
MMI Credentialed Programs and Courses, at this time, do not have web pages - and hence
no on-line registration.  People have to actually <i>apply</i> to
be a student of the Institute - just like any accredited school.
Application forms <i>are</i> available at the MMI web site.
<p>
Since MMI Programs have no web page 
"Web Ready" is forced to be off when creating/updating the program.
This goes for "Linked" and "Unlinked Dir" as well.
<p>
Registrations for an MMI <i>Course</i> (but not a
Public Course) are facilitated by the "Import"
link on the course Program page.  You are presented with 
the Credentialed programs that are concurrent with the course date range.
You choose one or more Credentialed programs and everyone in
these programs is registered for the course.  The housing
type choice is assigned individually - based on the most recent
housing type they were assigned.  Double is the default type.
The housing type is set, but the registrar still needs to go through
and house everyone individually.
<p>
MMI Public Courses DO, now, have web pages and online registration.
See the separate document about this.
<p>
People can register for only one Credentialed program at a time.
Such second registrations are prohibited.  When viewing
a registration in an MMI <i>Course</i> there is a link 'To Credentialed'
with which you can jump to their Credentialed registration.
<p>
Tuition for Credentialed Programs is quite flexible depending on
their ability to pay.  There are various creative discounts for payment
in full, etc.  So ... we don't really record the tuition <i>charges</i>.
The comment field in the Credentialed program registration screen
is used extensively to detail the payment arrangements that
have been made.
<p>

<h3>MMI Payments</h3>
We DO, however, keep close track of the <i>payments</i>.  All MMI Payments
are linked directly to the <b>person</b> not to the registrations.
On any MMI program registration screen there
is a section at the bottom named "MMI Payments" with
links "New" and "List".
<p>  
Choosing "New" to create a new MMI payment
you supply a dollar amount, type (credit/check/cash), what the payment
is for (Tuition/Fees/...) and an optional note.
<p>
The program where you clicked on the "New" link will
be remembered with the payment itself.  This means you could
make a tuition payment on a course registration.  This raises
the question - are all tuition payments really attached
to the Credentialed program?   (yes)
<p>
For general ledger accounting purposes MMI Programs
do not really have a single GL number.  Each MMI payment has its <i>own</i>
6 digit GL number which is computed automatically.
<p>
Each registrant making a payment is enrolled in just one Credentialed program.
<i>That</i> program and its Level are used to determine digits 2-6 below.
<p>
Digit 1 = what the payment is for:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Tuition</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Admin Fee</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clinic Fee</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Other</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Meals and Lodging are now paid to MMC directly (how?).
<p>
Digits 2-6 are determined by the Level of the Program:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th align=left>Level</th><th>Digits 2-6</th></tr>
<tr><td>CS YSC1</td><td>4YSC1</td></tr>
<tr><td>CS YSC2</td><td>4YSC2</td></tr>
<tr><td>CS YSL1</td><td>4YSL1</td></tr>
<tr><td>CS YSL2</td><td>4YSL2</td></tr>
<tr><td>YTT 200M</td><td>1200M</td></tr>
<tr><td>YTT 200S</td><td>1200S</td></tr>
<tr><td>YTT 300</td><td>1300M</td></tr>
<tr><td>AHC</td><td>2AHC1</td></tr>
<tr><td>CAP</td><td>2CAP1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Masters</td><td>2MAS1</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>
Actually, <i>anyone</i> can register for an MMI <i>course</i> - even people who
are not enrolled in a Credentialed program.  These are called &lsquo;Auditors&rsquo;.
When auditors make a payment (via "New" MMI Payment) 
the 6 digits of the GL Number of the MMI <i>course</i> itself is used
for the payment - preceded by digit 1 above (1 or 2 for
tuition or meals & lodging).
That makes for a 7 digit GL Number for auditors.
The GL Number of the <i>course</i> is <b>manually</b> input by the MMI administrator.
This must be done after the Program is created - a popup window will remind
the creator that this must be done and that they should confirm the
GL Number with the person in the Accounting office who has the role
'account_admin' within Reg.   
<ul>
<li>digit 2 = school # (from above).
<li>digit 3 = tens digit of year of the <i>beginning</i> date of the Credentialed program
of which this course is part.  How this is determined is unknown at this time but is known to the MMI Admin.
<li>digit 4 = units digit of that year.
<li>digit 5, 6, 7 = the 3 digit course # from the syllabus.
</ul>

<h3>Public Courses</h3>
If an MMI program has a level of 'Public Course' then 
everyone registering for it is treated as an 'auditor'.  The GL Number
of any payment is composed of a 1 or 2 (tuition or meals & lodging)
followed by the GL Number of the course.  This number should be as follows:
If a 3-digit course number is being used, follow the instructions
for assigning a Course number.  If no 3-digit course number is used,
the GL number should be:
<ul>
<li>digit 2 = school # (from above)
<li>digit 3 = tens digit of the year in which the course is held
<li>digit 4 = units digit of the year
<li>digit 5 = month (1-Jan, ...9=Sep, X=Oct, Y=Nov, Z=Dec)
<li>digit 6, 7 = two letters representing the name of the course (e.g. Spiritual Dimensions could be SD)
</ul>
Again, consult with the person in the Accounting office who has the
role 'account_admin' in Reg.

<h3>Extra Accounts</h3>
For Revenue from activities which are not part of the Programs Calendar,
use Extra Accounts.  This includes the static accounts Observations
(GL 524300), Donations (GL 524450), and Consultations.
Consultation GL Numbers are assigned as follows:
 
<ul>
<li>digit 1 = C
<li>digit 2 = school # (from above)
<li>digit 3 = tens digit of the year in which the course is held
<li>digit 4 = units digit of the year
<li>digit 5 = month (1-Jan, ...9=Sep, X=Oct, Y=Nov, Z=Dec)
<li>digit 6,7 = the first and second letters of the Faculty name (exception--Shrestha = SR) 
</ul>

<h3>List of MMI Payments</h3>
On an MMI program registration there is a link named "List"
for displaying all of a person's MMI payments.   On the Person
screen the link is "MMI Payments".
<p>
These fields are listed from the payment records:
<ul>      
<li>amount
<li>description
<li>date
<li>payment type
<li>program name
<li>note (optional)
</ul>
You can optionally show the GL number as well, if you wish,
with the link "Show GL".
<p>
Note that the program where a payment was made
was not recorded before Reg began to be used.

<h3>Financial Listings</h3>
In the Listings-Financial area there is a link to create MMI Deposits.
    These are all of the MMI Payments made since the last time
    an MMI Deposit was made.  These deposits are separate from
    the MMC program/rental deposits.
    <p>
    There is also a Period End Summary of MMI payments aggregated
    by GL Number.  The period defaults to the current month.
    In this listing there is a column headed 'ACCPAC Number'.
    This number is used for entry into the ACCPAC program
    used in the Financial Office.  It has this form:
<pre class=glnum>
    XXXX-0X-XXXX
</pre>
    The ACCPAC Number is derived from the GL Number thusly:
<p>
Application Fee for Masters program:
<pre class=glnum>
     GL Number: 3208XM
     GL Number:    3  2 08XM
ACCPACC Number: 4103-02-08XM
</pre>
<p>
Tuition for Diploma program:
<pre class=glnum>
     GL Number: 1208XD
     GL Number:    3  2 08XD
ACCPACC Number: 4103-02-08XD
</pre>
<p>
And for the 7 digit GL number for auditor payments:
<p>
Auditor Meals and Lodging:
<pre class=glnum>
     GL Number: 2209104
     GL Number:    2  2 09104
ACCPACC Number: 4202-02-09104
</pre>
If the last character of the GL Number is D, C, or M
then the first 3 numbers of the ACCPACC Number is 410
otherwise they are 420.

<h3>Calendar and DailyPic</h3>
Credentialed Programs (and Personal Retreats) are not shown on the
calendar (or the daily pic) as they would be annoyingly and
uselessly ever-present. MMI Courses <i>are</i> shown.

<h3>The MMI Admin</h3>
Within Reg there is a role called 'mmi_admin'.
Only users with this role can <i>see</i>
MMI registrations or payments or modify MMI programs.
Normal program admins/staff can see the programs but not modify them.
They can see the names of the registrants but not the actual
registration.  This is enforced via <i>whatever way</i> you might try to get
to the payments or registration or program.  A few examples:
<ul>
<li>The MMI payments are viewable via the person record
  of a person who is enrolled in an MMI program/course.
  You can't see these payments unless you are an mmi_admin.
<li>Clicking on an MMI person's room in the DailyPic
  or the ClusterView will show you their name but
  not allow you to click through to their
  registration - unless one of your roles is mmi_admin.
<li>Asking for the Early/Late registrations list from
  a program screen.  You'll see different things depending
  on your role.
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous MMI Things</h3>
In the list of registrants for Credentialed programs there are no markings
for housing or for a confirmation letter that needs to be sent.
There <i>is</i> still a 'cancelled' image.
<p>
In the list of registrants for an MMI <i>course</i> there <i>can</i> be
several markings next to the name:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td align=center><img src=/static/images/envelope.jpg height=25></td><td>Envelope - confirmation letter has not been sent.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><img src=/static/images/house.gif height=25></td><td>House - needs housing.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><img src=/static/images/unhappy1.gif height=15> <img src=/static/images/unhappy2.gif height=15></td><td>Unhappy faces - didn't get first/second housing choice.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center><img src=/static/images/redX.gif height=25></td><td>Red X - cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>C A</td><td>Credentialed or Auditor - The level of this student.</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
The envelope is only used for auditors and for when the
course is in the School of Massage.
<p>
Since MMI courses run from Friday morning to Sunday evening
they are charged for two nights lodging (at whatever housing type
rate they choose) <i>plus</i> one day at the commuting rate.
<p>
There is an affiliation named 'MMI Discount'.  If someone asks
for this discount it is given to them.  This gives them a 20% reduction
in lodging fees - but not tuition.
MMI people do not get membership discounts or the 10% discounts
for programs >= 7 or >= 30 days.
<p>
All these charges and discounts are enumerated on the registration screen.
