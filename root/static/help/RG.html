<h1>Transition to Retreat Guru</h1>
11/5/21
<p>
Hello, Vishwamitra.
<p>
I believe it's been quite a few years since Mount Madonna and Retreat Guru connected. Perhaps it was 2016?
<p>
As a means of introduction, I joined Retreat Guru in 2018, and work with our enterprise clients, like Esalen, Spirit Rock, Art of Living, Yogaville, and Sivananda Bahamas, to help them to gain the most benefit possible through Retreat Guru software and services.
<p>
I was pleased to read that Mount Madonna is again open for personal retreats and that your online classes are continuing. Are you hosting groups again, too?
<p>
Over the past year and a half, during the COVID challenge, Retreat Guru focused internally to build some exciting new features in our Retreat Management Software and polish our Marketplace (<a target=_blank href='https://retreat.guru'>retreat.guru</a>).
<p>
One of those developments was a shiny new Rentals module - to manage a group booking from initial inquiry, through quote building, acceptance of an agreement, collection of a deposit, to automatically building a program for participant registration, and final reconciliation.
<p>
Would you or another member of your team at Mount Madonna like to learn more about these new offerings? I'd love to chat.
<p>
If so, please view my calendar and choose a time that is convenient for you. 
I look forward to meeting you.

Dennis,
<p>
I'm Sahadev, the software fellow at Mount Madonna.
<p>
Please share more details about the Rentals Module.
Is there a document that I could review?
<p>
COVID has impacted MMC quite adversely.   
I presume the same is true for many retreat centers.
<p>

Hi Dennis,
<p>
I know your aim to get Mount Madonna Center to sign up for retreat.guru's software service.
<p>
Do you know the history?  MMC first contacted Cameron and Deryk in late 2016.
MMC already had extensive software in place and was wondering if retreat.guru would be a better alternative in that there was a team to support the software rather than just an individual (me).   It did not work out back then.   But we did share with Deryk a lengthy description of how we handled Rentals.
<p>
<a target=_blank href='http://www.logicalpoetry.com/rentals/'>http://www.logicalpoetry.com/rentals/</a>
<p>
And two youtube videos:
<p>
Part 1: <a target=_blank href='https://youtu.be/G4qshm0gAbo'>https://youtu.be/G4qshm0gAbo</a>
<p>
Part 2: <a target=_blankk href='https://youtu.be/fzCu9eoWsH4'>https://youtu.be/fzCu9eoWsH4</a>
<p>
You likely don't wish to review all this but I thought I would share anyway...
<p>
I am still supporting the software I wrote for MMC many years ago and rewrote in 2007.
<p>
It has gone through several iterations and likely will go through several more.
<p>
We can talk over Zoom if you wish.
One question I would have for you is how much did the above information I shared in 2016 help retreat.guru in its design process for the current Rentals features?
<p>
Sahadev (aka Jon)
<p>
[ In October 2016 I also shared a <a target=_blank href=mp_cal.html>document</a> and <a target=_blank href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIH5MxCxANg&ab_channel=JonBjornstad'>video</a> about Meeting Places and the Calendar as done in Reg.

<p>
Hi Sahadev,
<p>
Thank you for your very detailed description of rentals at MMC. I've read it through and look forward to viewing your accompanying videos.
<p>
Although I didn't join Retreat Guru until 2018, I am aware that our two organizations previously explored a development relationship and that a Statement of Work was proposed in late 2016. Both Cameron and Deryk were deeply involved in the design of our new rentals feature and shared experiences from their engagement with MMC and other key centers.
<p>
I'm not sure if our new rentals feature is a good fit for MMC, but I am very curious and look forward to exploring this possibility with you.
<p>
By the way, we've made great strides in other areas of our software as well - modules to enable programs delivered online, enhancements to our API, significant updates to the online registration form, lodging management and reporting, and more.
<p>
I look forward to chatting with you on Monday.
<div class=sahadev>

<p>
Thank you.

<p>
Thank you, Dennis. 
That was fun.
<p>
I'm impressed that the 'hot spot' on my phone could handle that entire Zoom session!
<p>
I do wonder how much data from my plan was used! &#128522;
<p>
Jon (aka Sahadev)
</div>
<hr>
My pleasure, Jon. I quite enjoy talking with you!
<hr>
2/22/22
<p>
Hi Sahadev,
<p>
You asked about our database structure and how data is segmented for our clients.
<p>
Here's a note that our developers shared with me, "We segment each center's data at the table level. Although all sites work within the same database, each center has its own set of individual tables."
<p>
Does that address your interest?
<p>
Dennis Marriott
<hr>

<p>
Hi Sahadev,
<p>
Happy spring!
<p>
It's been some time since we connected, so I'm just checking in to see if there's anything we can do for you at this point. 
<p>
Did you have an opportunity to chat with your director about RG as a potential future transition option for MMC?
<p>
Dennis Marriot
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
Hi Dennis,
<p>
Yes, I did chat with the directors.<br>
Yes, the idea of having a team to support the registration software instead of an individual (me) is still a topic of interest and concern.<br>
Yes, at some point we will transition from Reg to retreat.guru. <br>
There is not much other choice, is there?   What are the other options?
<p>
No, we are not yet ready to transition.<br>
Mount Madonna Center (MMC) is still very much in the process of recovering/reorganizing their business post pandemic (are we actually post pandemic?) and being financially responsible.  <br>
As Abraham Lincoln (one of our most esteemed presidents) said, "It is best to not swap horses mid-stream."<br>
I don't know when the stream will have been safely crossed and when we will be ready to transition.
<p>
I know that when we DO switch to RG I will be the key person to help with the migration of data and with the retraining of the staff at MMC.   I am the world's expert on how MMC does their registration and rentals.  I know everything about it because I created it - "from scratch" - starting in 1987 (35 years!).
<p>
I *have* been tasked with doing the research to see what a transition would look like, how long it would take, and how much it would cost.   I have not started that research yet because I have been occupied with various requests for adapting the software we are currently using (Reg).
<p>
So, given all this, please remind me where the RG 'sandbox' for MMC is.
Where is the documentation?   Where are the tutorial videos?
Can you point me to a retreat center that has done a large scale migration?
Is there someone at that center I could speak with?
After I review these things I will inevitably have questions and I will contact you.
<p>
Thank you,<br>
Sahadev
</div>

<div class=sahadev>
When did Spirit Rock and Esalen begin using RG?
</div>
<hr>
Esalen went live with Retreat Guru in 2018. Spirit Rock in mid-2019.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
Please send contact information for Spirit Rock and for Esalen.
They are relatively nearby and I could go visit and have an in-person chat.
</div>
<hr>
Sahadev,
<p>
Kevin Kelly, IT Manager at Spirit Rock, is looking forward to chatting with you.
<p>
You can reach Kevin at <a href='mailto:kevink@spiritrock.org'>kevink@spiritrock.org</a>
<p>
By the way, we recently did a <a target=_blank href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o301ez1cqUn_M3hf-6mrMPUeLS1ihy4E/view'>case study on Spirit Rock</a>.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
I will contact Kevin.
<p>
I looked at the case study.
It seems that Spirit Rock had a very haphazard collection of awkward tools to handle their operation.   So, no wonder your solution was a no-brainer for them to adopt.
<p>
Mount Madonna Center has a very efficient system that has been in place for years.
</div>

<p>
Hi, I'm still working on a reference at Esalen. They have experienced quite a few changes recently in their team structure and most of the people who were involved in the tech stack upgrade decisions and implementation are no longer with the organization. I'm meeting with them next week and will hopefully be able to identity the best person for you to contact.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
5/8/22
<p>
Dennis,
<p>
Today I'm going to dig in more deeply into how RG works.
And keep notes on what I find so I can make a report to the executives here.
<p>
Do you also have references for Yogaville, Himalayan Institute, and Hollyhock?
<p>
I'm also curious about a larger view of your clients.
How many?
When did they start using RG and how many programs do they offer?
Have any clients stopped using RG?
I suspect that once a center has their data in RG it is hard to go back.
<p>
Do clients have read-only SQL access to the database?
<p>
Have clients with a long history migrated all of their data to RG or have they simply started afresh and looked forward?    I know that migrations are not easy to do.
<p>
MMC might just start afresh.
For marketing purposes it might make sense to migrate the people (and their contact information).
Or just the people who have had contact with the center in the last 5 years or so?
<p>
Thank you,<br>
Jon

<p>
Sahadev,
<p>
Thank you for the update.
<p>
Deryk and Cameron Wenaus started a web development company for Tibetan Lamas about 25 years ago. In 2013, they began growing Retreat Guru and developing a Retreat Management System (RMS) to address the unique needs of retreats and holistic learning centres. Retreat Guru currently serves over 300 SaaS clients and about 4000 centers list on the retreat.guru marketplace.
<p>
The churn rate for Retreat Guru SaaS centers is very low, and practically nil for our enterprise-level clients.
<p>
I will contact Yogaville, Himalayan Institute, and Hollyhock and ask if they are available to chat with you. I'll follow up with you as soon as I have confirmation from them.
<p>
Regarding the migration of data from pre-existing systems to Retreat Guru, most of our new enterprise-level clients complete such prior to their initial go-live date. If you choose to complete a data import, we recommend limiting historical data to the previous 3-5 years of non-transactional records - programs and registrations, but not transactions. We can also import future programs and registrations (with transactions). Read more about our <a target=_blank href='https://help.retreat.guru/knowledge/data-import'>schema for data import</a>.
<p>
We provide an <a target=_blank href='https://help.retreat.guru/knowledge/retreat-guru-api'>open API</a> for your use when retrieving and updating data within Retreat Guru databases. We currently do not provide direct SQL access.
<p>
Let me know if additional questions develop as you continue your deep dive.

Excellent.
<p>
So there are 300 centers using the RG registration software?
<p>
And 4,000 different centers list their retreats on the marketplace but 3,700 of them don't use RG?
4,000 centers or there are 4,000 individual programs/retreats on the RG marketplace?
<p>
Impressive!
</div>
<hr>
5/10/22
<p>
Hi Jon, thank you for prompting me to double-check the numbers. I had not referenced the most recent stats.
<p>
We have about 380 client centers using Retreat Guru. Of those 380, about 250 use the full RMS to manage their retreat operations, the remaining centers just list on marketplace.
<p>
The 4000 figure was the number of programs listed by our client centers on the marketplace pre-COVID. The current number of programs listed is about 2000.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
Dennis,
<p>
RMS stands for 'retreat management software'?
It is also the initials of Richard Mathew Stallman - a controversial pioneer in open source software.
<p>
The current number of programs in the marketplace is ~2000.   
That's a lot!   
How many are online and how many in-person?
I'm happy to see that the world is getting beyond COVID and in-person retreats are happening again.
Those are all _future_ programs?
How long do _past_ programs stay on the marketplace?
Let's see ... 2000/380 = 5.26
On average these centers have 5 or 6 future programs?
<p>
Do some centers have their own software to manage their operation but still post programs on the marketplace with a registration link to their own site?   Or do all marketplace programs lead to a RG registration?
<p>
So many questions.  Sorry.
<p>
I still have not played in the MMC RG sandbox.  Maybe today.
<p>
Sahadev (aka Jon)
</div>
<hr>
Hi Sahadev, no worries, keep those questions coming :)
<p>
RMS = Retreat Management System
<p>
Yes, about 2000 programs are listed on the marketplace. The mix of online and on-site has varied over the past years. Recently, the number of on-site programs has been increasing and the number of online programs decreasing. The marketplace features future programs. Past programs do not appear.
<p>
Technically, all bookings through the marketplace result in a registration in Retreat Guru software. The centers that "only list" are actually using a light version of Retreat Guru, without access to most retreat management components.
<p>
Our SaaS clients, those that use the full-featured RMS, can easily list their programs on the marketplace. The listing option is integrated with the add/edit program functionality. Centers can choose to list (or not) on a program-by-program basis.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
What are the various components of RG?<br>
I presume the more components that are used the more the center pays each month, yes?
</div>
<hr>
Our enterprise-level clients have access to all features as part of their software subscription. The threshold for enterprise clients is 2000 registrations per year and more than $1 Million in annual revenue. I've been operating on the assumption that MMC will qualify as an enterprise client.
<p>
Our base subscription plans for Small-to-Medium Businesses (SMB) clients include basic functionality. SMB clients have the option to purchase additional feature sets as needed.

Sahadev,
<p>
<span class=sahadev>RG is implemented in WordPress and PHP and Javascript?</span> RG is implemented in Wordpress, PHP, and Javascript with a little bit of Vue.js and node / npm.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>Git for source control?</span> Yes, Git is used for source control.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>What database?</span> MySQL
<p>
<span class=sahadev>What javascript libraries?</span> We use assorted javascript libraries. Most notable are jQuery and Alpine.js
<p>
<span class=sahadev>What WP Plugins?</span> Retreat Guru currently uses the plugins listed below. In general, Retreat Guru does not support the addition of other WP plugins by a client center.
<ul>
<li>Classic Editor - enables the WordPress classic editor and the old-style Edit Post screen with TinyMCE, Meta Boxes, etc.
<li>Members - allows us to edit your roles and their capabilities, clone existing roles, assign multiple roles per user.
<li>Really Simple CAPTCHA - a module intended to be called from other plugins. It is originally created for my Contact Form 7 plugin.
<li>Send E-mails with Mandrill - Send e-mails using Mandrill. This is a forked version of the now unsupported plugin wpMandrill.
<li>User Switching - instant switching between user accounts in WordPress.
<li>WP Crontrol - view and control what's happening in the WP-Cron system.
</ul>
<span class=sahadev>What modules/libraries in PHP?</span> We use assorted PHP libraries delivered by composer.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>Hosted on AWS?</span> We use a managed hosting company named Pagely, which uses AWS infrastructure.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>What other software is used?</span> There are a variety of software packages running on our server managed by Pagely, but for the purposes of RG, we don't use anything outside of the standard LAMP setup (Apache, nginx, MySQL, PHP).  We use RDS for MySQL, so our dB data is segmented from the server.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>What is used for bug tracking?</span> Internally, Retreat Guru uses ClickUp for bug tracking, dev sprints, product planning, etc. We use HubSpot to manage our client-facing support services.
<p>
<span class=sahadev>Sidekick for email? Mailchimp?</span> We don't use Sidekick. We use Mandrill (owned by Mailchimp) to deliver email.

<div class=sahadev>
Dennis,
<p>
Thank you for all this.<br>
Lots of good stuff!
<p>
When you have sent a link in email it actually first goes to t.sidekickopen87.com and then to the link you intended.   I understand that this is to tally which links were clicked on.   Sorta nice to know.  Pretty fancy.
<p>
I will ask the references you provided (Spirit Rock, Himalayan Institute) what other choices they considered.  Asking you ... what is your competition?  Is there more generic hotel or event management software that might work for some of your clients?
<p>
Sahadev
</div>
<hr>
Sahadev,
<p>
The link notification is due to our HubSpot CRM.
<p>
Regarding competition, for large centers the alternative to Retreat Guru is usually <i>status quo</i> - staying with what they have, whether developed in-house or a third-party like Resort Suite, WebRezPro, or another hotel PMS.
<p>
Spirit Rock used Raiser's Edge from Blackbaud prior to migrating to Retreat Guru. Himalayan Institute used WebRezPro. Esalen used a proprietary (in-house developed) reservation software. Yogaville used an in-house solution using FileMakerPro. Hollyhock used a legacy hotel system shielded from admin users by an in-house developed Access dB "front end".
<p>
I'm not aware of another Retreat Management System purpose-built to serve the unique needs of retreats and holistic learning centers.
Dennis,
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
Thank you for all this.
<p>
What about Breitenbush Hot Springs in Oregon?  Are you in touch with them?  I know that circa 2007 they were working with a company called OpenSourcery to develop a system in Ruby on Rails.   That was quite a while ago.   We considered joining their effort but instead opted to have me rewrite the prior ancient version of our Reg (called reg &#128522; written from 1987-2007 in dBaseIII+) in Perl.
<p>
That rewrite - named Reg - went live in 2009 and has served us well ever since.
Lots of changes since then.
<p>
I just went to <a target=_blank href='https://breitenbush.com'>breitenbush.com</a> and started to book a personal retreat and it redirected to <a target=_blank href='https://resnexus.com'>resnexus.com</a>
<p>
Do you know anything about <a target=_blank href='https://resnexus.com'>resnexus.com</a>?
<p>
Breitenbush is starting to host programs again.  Here's what's happening in June:
<p>
<a target=_blank href='https://breitenbush.com/workshops#june'>Breitenbush in June</a>
<p>
Clicking on Register for one of them I see it redirected to resnexus.
Others go to the individual presenter's website.
Another goes too Breitenbush.pnwschool.com for lodging.
<p>
Hmmmm.
<p>
Jon
</div>
<hr>
Hi Jon,
<p>
We were engaged with Breitenbush a few times over the years, most recently in 2019. At that time they were using an application they referred to as BLISS for payment transactions (store, healing arts, registrations), and FileMakerPro for internal tracking, daily financial reports, and gift certificates. 
<p>
They had many unique "required" features, most of which we quoted custom development. At the end (2019), they opted to allocate their resources to bolstering their in-house system rather than sourcing a new solution.
<p>
I've heard of ResNexus, a hotel management system, but I don't recall Breitenbush using it. Maybe that's a new direction they have taken.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
5/11/22
<p>
Dennis,
<p>
Thank you for this history regarding Breitenbush.  
<p>
Of course, it raises yet other questions! &#128522;
<p>
What are your charges for custom development?  Do other clients see the custom features or are they visible only to the one that asked for them?  How many clients have asked for such things? What are a few examples?
<p>
I do know that in 2016 MMC inquired about new features regarding Rentals.  And I sent extensive documentation and video explaining how Reg did it.   I don't remember if we paid anything. 
<p>
Sahadev (aka Jon)
</div>
<hr>
Sahadev,
<p>
We recommend the following approach as we renew our journey.
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 - discovery and planning, ten 2-hour sessions.
<li>Phase 2 - configuration and training, 4 weeks.
<li>Phase 3 - import, integrate, and go live, 4 weeks.
<li>Phase 4 - post-go-live support, 4 weeks.
</ul>
<i>Phase 1 - discovery and planning</i> is designed to help us both determine if the Retreat Guru RMS is a good fit for your organization. We will:
<ul>
<li>Define success for your project;
<li>Confirm a decision and implementation process;
<li>Map your operations to our software and services;
<li>Identify gaps, risks, and mitigation strategies; and,
<li>Confirm costs for future phases, through launch, go-live, and beyond.
</ul>
Retreat Guru will assign a Project Consultant to work directly with your organization. We request that you designate a Project Manager to be our primary contact and to coordinate the involvement of your key stakeholders. Your ideal Project Manager will have deep knowledge of all relevant operational areas within your organization, be experienced with change management, and be your champion for success, through implementation and beyond. And, of course, you sound like the perfect Project Manager :)
<p>
Key deliverables of Phase 1 are confirming one-time development costs (if any) and your ongoing software subscription rate. If you request feature polish, custom features, or other special services, and we determine that such development is feasible, we will quote on an item-by-item basis. Again, you will know these costs before you commit to Phase 2 - configuration and training.
<p>
Our consultation fee for Phase 1 is $2000 for up to ten 2-hour sessions within a 3-week period.
<p>
We typically only consider custom development for enterprise-level clients. In the past, some, but not all, enterprise clients have requested custom development. The most common was to create a custom export (csv format) of registration or transaction data to facilitate a basic integration with the center's accounting system or donor management system.
<p>
A custom development may eventually become a core feature or component of our software, available to all clients. In other cases, the request is so specific to a particular organization that it is not applicable to others.
<hr>
<div class=sahadev>
Nicely laid out.<br>
I can see why your title is 'Success Architect'.
<p>
What are the typical fees for Phases 2-4?
</div>
<hr>
Sahadev, thank you :)
<p>
Your payment for the software subscription and for one-time development (if any) will be due at the start of Phase 2 - Configuration and Training. Your software subscription rate is based primarily upon forecast registration count and registration revenue. If you are able to share your registration forecast, I can provide an estimate of the software subscription rate.

Are there fees for Phases 2-4?<br>
That's an expected 12 week period of time.

Sorry if I've added confusion. Your regular software subscription starts at the start of Phase 2, so there isn't any separate fee for Phase 2, 3, or 4. 
<p>
For example, assume you pay $2000 for Phase 1, and we set your start date for Phase 2 - configuration and training to be July 1, 2022. Your annual software subscription payment of $xx,xxx would be due on July 1st, and we would begin Phase 2 on July 1st, then proceed through Phase 3 and 4, and through the remaining months of your first annual term. Your subscription renewal would be due July 1, 2023.

Ok.<br>
Got it.<br>
<p>
I'm going to play with the MMC "sandbox" extensively before contacting the references.

Sahadev,
<p>
I understand that you wish to explore the sandbox site extensively before contacting the references. That may be beneficial, but please realize that I chose the references as senior leaders who could speak to their experience planning and implementing their migration from a legacy system to Retreat Guru, and their ongoing experience with the platform and the relationship between our organizations. For the most part, they are best positioned to speak at a higher level than feature-specific inquiries.
<p>
When evaluating Retreat Guru's fit, many centers prepare a list of use cases that cover key aspects of their daily operations, registrations, bookings, room inventory management, other processes, and reporting. We can then review those use cases together and explore how Retreat Guru may, or may not, address them. We typically find that most use cases can be addressed with our core features, some use cases would require polish of existing features or custom development, and some (typically few) use cases cannot be addressed by our software and would require workaround strategies or changes to your internal processes.

Dennis,
<p>
I understand. 
<p>
Thank you for your guidance.  Clearly you have a great deal of experience in this area. 
<p>
Mount Madonna Center is not feeling any urgency at the moment about moving away from my software.  Exploring how Retreat Guru would work for us is in the realm of "future planning".
