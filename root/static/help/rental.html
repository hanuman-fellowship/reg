<h2>Rentals from A to Z</h2>
<p>
A call (or email) comes in for a proposed rental.
<h3>Fill out a Proposal</h3>
    First choose Rentals from the top menu.
    Then choose the Proposals link.
    Then Add.
<ul>
    <li>Contact Person<br>
    Note the required fields.
        On leaving the last name field, Reg will fill
        in the rest from prior data from the People table, if it is available.
    <li>IF the Contract Signer is different from the contact person
        there is a link 'Contract Signer?' which will open up an
        additional area to enter the info.
        This also auto fills from prior data.
    <li>Max - maximum number of people that may come.
    <li>Dates requested<br>
        This can be as verbose and as vague as you wish.
    <li>Default check in is 4:00, default check out is 1:00
        You CAN put hh:mm for minutes.  Like 4:30.
        No need to enter am/pm because it is assumed
        that 8:00 is am and 7:00 is pm.  This is okay, yes?
    <li>Program meeting date is important.  This is when the program
    director and staff will meet to consider this proposal.
    Can enter dates in many ways - see other help page for this.
    <li>Deposit field is required.
</ul>
<p>
    The several multiline text fields have a fancy editor for 
        Word-like formatting.
<p>
    After entry you see the list of all proposals.
    They are listed in order of program meeting date.
        Only current or future ones are shown.
        You can search for others by the group's name.
        For a wildcard you can use asterisk '*'.

    You can edit/update/delete them as usual.
<p>
The program meeting then happens and decisions are made
    to Approve or Deny the proposals.  The decision depends on
    what else is happening at the center, whether a meeting space
    is available, and many other factors.  The Calendar is an
    effective tool to help make the decision.  Perhaps alternate
    date is better for the center.
<h3>Deny</h3>
    If Deny,
        Choose Edit, check 'Denied' and possibly put a reason in
        Miscellaneous Notes.
        Then click 'Transmit' to move contact person (and contract signer)
            to People for later reference.
<h3>Create a Rental</h3>
    If Approve - click 'Approve'.
        This brings up a Rental creation screen (in a new window)
            with these fields already filled in from the information
            in the proposal:

<ul>
<li>Check in, Check out
<li>Tentative - still 'yes' - will not be tentative when the contract is signed
and deposit payment is received.
<li>Rental Name (the proposal group name)
<li>Contact Person/Contract Signer
<li>Max
<li>Deposit
</ul>

Note that the Rental screen has 4 tabs:
<ol>
<li>Meals & Lodging
<li>Misc
<li>Finance
<li>Web
</ol>
Fill in start, end date and hit Submit.
A rental is thus created.
<p>
The Rental's Summary is automatically created.
Note that Food Service,
Leader Housing,
Misc Notes + Special Needs + Provisos, etc
are taken directly from the Proposal and added
to the Food Service, Leader Housing, and Miscellaneous Notes fields in the Summary.
<p>
The Contact Person and Contract Signer in the proposal
are automatically 'transmitted' to the People table
with affiliation 'Proposal Submitter' - for later marketing purposes.
<p>
After a Proposal is 'Approved' you can no longer modify it.
    You can go back and forth between the Proposal and the Rental
    with links (To Rental/To Proposal) on each screen.
    Similarily, after the contact person (and contract signer)
    have been 'Transmitted' you cannot modify them on the Proposal.
    Instead, you modify their info in the People screen.
    From the Proposal and the Rental you can get to the people
    screen in one click on a link.
<p>
Rentals can also be created directly without going through
    the proposal process.  Choose 'Add' on the Rentals list screen.
    One difference is that you need to add the contact person
    separately in People and then retype their name after
    choosing 'Update' next to the Contact Person field in Rentals.
    Similarily for Contract Signer if not the same as the Contact Person.
<p>
Several other things need to be done to make the rental complete:
<ul>
<li>Choose the appropriate housing cost.
Note that it cannot be the default - the default
is for Programs and Personal Retreats not Rentals.
If the rental will be having lunches the housing cost
should reflect this - the housing cost name must contain
the word 'lunch'.
<li>Assign meeting places and breakout places.
<li>Choose which days have lunches.
Note that if the rental begins after 1:00 they
cannot have lunch on the first day.
<li>Verify the GL Number which was automatically computed.
<li>Enter any comment and web information, if provided.
        Check 'Linked' if the organization wants their information public.
        The web stuff will appear on the Events Calendar
            at www.mountmadonna.org.
        Some organizations won't want their information public
            but some will.  From an MMC perspective I think it is nice
            to be able to show that there are many other things
            happening at the center.
</ul>
<h3>MMC Does Registration and Parallel Programs</h3>
The field 'MMC Does Registration' on the Misc tab is normally unchecked.
<p>
For special rentals (like AVI and OGS) MMC does the individual
registration for them but it <i>is</i> still a Rental - from a financial
and contractual perspective.  In order to do the registrations
and generate a web page on which people can register online you
will need to create a <i>parallel</i> 'Program' with the <i>same name</i> and
the <i>same dates</i> as the 'Rental'.  You will not be
able to assign any meeting spaces or breakout spaces to this program.
This program will not appear on the calendar at all - not even
in the 'No Where' place.  The original rental <i>will</i> appear.
<p>
To help you to not forget to create this parallel program Reg
will bring you to a Program creation dialog when you first check
'MMC Does Registration' on the Rental screen.  The name and dates
will be filled in from the rental.  The rest of the program attributes
(including the web page information) is up to you.
<span help="color: red">Do not change the name or the dates!</span>
You <i>can</i> but you would only confuse yourself and others!
<p>
Once the parallel program is created you can easily go back and forth
between the rental and its program with the 'To Program' and
'To Rental' links.
<p>
In the lists of all rentals and programs
these special rentals and their parallel programs will be
marked with the word 'Hybrid'.
<p>
When you click on the Summary for a parallel program
you are actually seeing the Summary for its parallel rental.
This makes sense, yes?  We only want one Summary for this
hybrid entity.
</ul>
<h3>Rental Status</h3>
Each rental has a 'status' which is displayed in the 4th column in the
list of rentals
and also on the rental screen after the date range.
It shows the progress through time of the rental:
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>Tentative</td></tr>
<tr><td>Contract Sent</td></tr>
<tr><td>Contract Received</td></tr>
<tr><td>Letter Sent</td></tr>
<tr><td>Due</td></tr>
<tr><td>Done</td></tr>
</table>
Each status has its own color - which can be
    changed in Configuration > Colors.
    This color is prominently visible when viewing the list of rentals,
    each rental screen, and also as a <i>border</i> color in the Calendar.
<p>
The second line of menus on the Rental screen is an <i>ordered</i> sequence like so:
<ul>
<li>Contract
<li>Email Contract
<li>Received
<li>Arrangements
<li>Email Arrangements
<li>Invoice
</ul>
The MMC rental coordinator chooses these menu items in order - as the rental
progresses through time.
<h3>Contract</h3>
Once the rental screen creation is complete you can generate a contract
    by simply choosing 'Contract'.
    This is a legal document and hence needs to be examined
    and vetted carefully.
    Double check the housing costs.  Seminar house use
    affects the contract.  Lunches do, too.
    Try the various combinations.
    Read the meal times carefully.
<p>
The contract should be sent (emailed) to the Contact
Person for their signature.  This also requests a deposit check.
Generating the contract will put the current date in the
    'Contract Sent' field and change the status from 'Tentative'
    to 'Contract Sent'.  
<p>
When the contract is received <i>back</i> you can click on 
the menu item 'Received' to put the date the contract was 
received (i.e. today) in the
Contract Received field.  This field can also be edited manually if you wish.
The deposit check should also be entered as a Payment (in the
Finance tab).  The rental status will changed to 'Contract Received'.
<p>
<h3>Arrangements</h3>
The MMC Rental Coordinator can now begin the conversation
about the <i>arrangements</i> - all the things in the Summary.
One of these is the Gate Code.
<p>
There is a link in the menu titled 'Arrangements' and 'Email Arrangements'.
This is an email sent to the Contact Person and the Contract Signer
that explains many things - housing procedure, gate code, schedule,
meeting space setup, sound equipment, map, food service, etc.
There are also 4 documents attached to this email:
<ul>
<li>Map of MMC Main Area
<li>Guest Confirmation Letter
<li>Food Information
<li>Schedules, Recreation/Leisure Activities, Safety, Other Misc Info
</ul>
<p>
One important thing in this letter is the Web URL to the web grid for
the rental housing.   This is where the Contact Person puts the 
names of the people
attending the rental to assign them specific rooms (aka houses)
according to their preferred housing choice.  Since this is on the
global web rather than on Reg it is visible anywhere in the world.
For a measure of security, the Web URL contains a 6 letter secret
(randomly generated and essentially unguessable) code that is
unique to the specific Rental.
<p>
Note that these housing assignments
are <i>entirely</i> the responsibility of the Contact Person,
not anyone at MMC.   Also note that we do not collect any demographic
information <i> at all</i> on the people being housed.  
The Contact Person could simply put "John", "Mary", "Bill & Hillary",
"Melissa and child", etc.  in the fields for the beds in the room.
They also note which nights the person will be there - they default
to every day of the rental.
<p>
The Web Grid calculates a cost for each
person and displays it in the grid.   The cost depends on how many
other people are in the room - and, of course, on the housing cost (which is
displayed at the bottom of the grid).  As an example, say person A in a Double
room has a roommate (person B) for the first night.  They will both pay
the Double rate for that night.  If person B
leaves the next day, person A will pay the Single rate for the
rest of the rental.
<p>The costs displayed on the grid are used by the Contact Person
to charge the people they housed.   The total of all these housing costs
is used in the Invoice to calculate the total amount due to MMC.
<p>The MMC rental coordinator can see exactly what the Contact Person sees
by clicking on the link 'Web Grid'.  They shouldn't change anything there!
<p>Every 15 minutes 24/7 a program (a cron job) runs that transfers any changes
in the web housing grids (for any active Rentals) from the global web on
www.mountmadonna.org to the computer that Reg runs on (for security it is behind a VPN [virtual private network]).   People using
Reg can then see the housing assignments by clicking on the Rental
menu link 'Local Grid'.  On that screen is a link 'Grab New'
which can be used by those who
don't want to wait for the next 15 minute transfer/checking interval. 
<h4>Housing</h4>
There is an ongoing conversation between the Contact Person
and the MMC Rental Coordinator about how many
people will be coming and what kind of housing
they will want.  This information is entered into the
Meals/Lodging tab of the Rental.
<p>
Entire housing clusters can be booked (or cancelled) for a rental
in one fell swoop.  Choose 'Update' to the right of 'Cluster Reservations'.
<p>
When booking rooms individually you can select as many as you wish.
You click on 'Add' next to a housing type (Single w/Bath, Single, Double, etc.)
and then choose the houses (aka Rooms) that you wish.
<p>
Another option is to create a 'Block'.  This reserves the space for the
rental but doesn't (yet) add it to the actual housing pool for the rental.
<p>
You delete houses by clicking directly on the name
and then confirming you wish to delete it.  There is also 'Mass Delete'
where you can delete more than one at a time.
<p>
When you have added/deleted all needed houses you click on the phrase
'Send to Web' (in red color next to the link 'Web Grid' on the Meals/Lodging tab).
This sends the information to the global web where it is visible
to the rental Contact Person.  After you click on the 'Send to Web' link
it disappears.  Whenever you add or delete a house it will reappear.
It will also appear if you change the Housing Cost type.
<p>
The DailyPic can be consulted to see what houses have been assigned
and reserved for the Rental.
<h3>Emailing the Summary</h3>
The 'Arrangements' letter above was sent early on in the process
to begin the discussion of the specific needs of the Rental.
These are entered into the 'Summary'.  It is important that the Contact
Person knows exactly what the Summary contains so that they and the Center
are 'on the same page'.   On the Summary screen there is a menu link
'Email'.  This is used to send the summary to the Contact Person
and the Contract Signer.  You can add Cc emails, change the Subject,
and the Introductory note for the email.  The email will contain
the entire Summary page.  The introductory note default is in Configuration > Strings.  
<p>Note: If the Summary has been updated since it was last sent
there is a red asterisk next to the menu choices 'Sum' and 'Summary',
and the 'Email' link is in red.
<h3>Post Rental</h3>
The Rental comes and all hopefully went well.
<p>
The coordinator can now choose 'Invoice' to get a nicely laid out and
    accurate invoice to print for the Contact Person.  Actually,
    as usual, it is as accurate as the input data.
<p>
A check is made out for the unpaid balance and it is entered
    as a Payment on the Rental.  The status of the Rental changes to 'Done'.
<p>
If the full payment was not made on the last day of the Rental 
    the status becomes 'Due' - with its own unique color to 
    make it stand out.  This Rental will continue to be at the top
    of the Rentals list until the payment is made.
