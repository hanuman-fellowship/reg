<h2>Rides</h2>
MMC is many things: a restaurant, a hotel, a campground,
a conference center.  It is also an <span help="color: red; font-weight: bold">Airporter Service</span>.
We arrange rides between the center and the 4 local airports.
<h3>Creating A Ride</h3>
Only a person with the role of Ride Administrator can create a ride.
Everyone can view them.
This is how a ride is created:
<ol>
<li>Find a person or add them anew.
<li>View that person and choose the 'Ride' link
to create a ride <i>to</i> MMC.
<li>Fill in whatever information you have about
the person's flight and credit card information.
<p>
You can enter dates and times in a variety of convenient formats.
Like '3' or '4 5' for dates or '123' or '0324' or '1:56 p' for times.
See the other help topics for full details.
<p>
When entering credit card information the cursor will
jump to the next field automatically when you have entered
enough digits.  This should make entry easy and fast.
<p>
<li>Assign a driver when you can determine who it should be.
</ol>
This creates the ride.
<p>
You can view <i>all</i> rides by choosing the 'Rides' link at the top.
This shows all current and future rides <i>and</i> all
those that have not yet been paid.
They are listed in order by date, time and airport - this helps
in determining if rides can be shared.
If you wish to see a ride that happened in the past or if you wish to search
for a rider's last name there is a way to enter a date range
and/or a name pattern - this will then display the rides you seek.
<p>
When a driver logs in they will first see only <i>their</i> future rides.
The 'Rides' link at the top or a date range/name pattern search
will include other drivers as well.
<p>
If some information about a ride is missing (like flight information
or credit card data) the ride will be marked on the left with a little, round,
blue question mark <img src=/static/images/question.jpg height=20>.
<p>
You can view a ride by clicking on the rider's name.
Clicking on the drivers name will show you that driver's
user information plus all of the rides they have given
in reverse chronological order.
<p>
If you made a typo when entering the credit card number (swapped digits,
mistyped digit) it will be marked with an unhappy face.
This provides some minimal error checking but does not
ensure that the card is actually valid.
<p>
You can edit the ride by choosing 'Edit'.
<h3>The Return Ride</h3>
When viewing a ride <i>to</i> MMC you can optionally create
another ride for the person <i>from</i> MMC back to the airport.
Choosing the 'Return' link will begin creating this return ride for the person
setting the direction to 'From MMC' and 
with the same airport and the same carrier as the To ride.
<h3>Confirmation Letter</h3>
When a ride is complete - all required information is present - then
it will be marked with an envelope <img src=/static/images/envelope.jpg height=20> - meaning that you are now
ready to send the confirmation letter.  Choose the ride (click on the
rider's name) and select the red '<span help="color: red">Send</span>'.
This will send an email
to both the driver and the rider detailing the flight information.
The letter includes telephone numbers for both the rider and the driver.
The cost and cancellation policy is there as well.
Here is a sample letter:
<ul>
Dear Charles,
<p>
This letter is to confirm that you have a ride scheduled
from Mount Madonna Center to the Oakland airport.

</table>
<p>
This ride will cost $85 and will be charged to your credit card.<br>
It may cost less if it can be arranged for you to share the ride with others.
<p>
If you cancel your flight and do not notify us in advance to cancel this ride
a penalty of $25 will charged to your card.
<p>
If any of this information is in error please contact us as soon as possible.
<p>
Thank you,<br>
Sukhdev Pettingill<br>

</ul>
If the rider does not have an email address this letter will
be displayed on the screen.   You can print it and then snail mail
it to the person.
<p>
When the confirmation letter is sent the current date is put
in the 'Date Sent' field of the ride.
You can <i>RE</i>send the confirmation letter (after modifying the ride in
some way, perhaps) by choosing 'ReSend'.
<p>
At this point it is the driver's responsibility to contact
the rider and arrange for the exact pickup time and place.
<h3>Payment</h3>
After the ride has happened the driver is paid and the rider's credit
card is charged.  This is done by choosing 'Pay' above the list of rides
or when viewing a ride.  This brings up a list of all completed
and unpaid rides.  The credit card information is in a very visible
larger font.  The AVS (address verification system) data is shown as well.
This consists the digits from the first address line and the zip code.
This is used for authenticating the credit card and results in a slightly
lower rate for MMC to pay for the charge service.
<p>
When you have finished charging the cards put a check by the ones
that you charged.  You can check 'All' to speed this up.
Press Submit.  Now these rides will be marked with a green check mark
<img src=/static/images/checked.gif height=20>
to indicate 'paid'.  The date the payment was made is also
recorded in the ride.
<h3>Clearing Credit Cards, Sending Txt Msgs</h3>
To Do: 
<ol>
<li>Once a day (at midnight or so) a process will run to clear out
any credit card information that is no longer needed.
<li>Once a day in the morning a txt msg is sent to drivers
reminding them of their rides that day.  To make this happen
the drivers have to put a txt msg email address in their user profile.
The txt msg will contain the rider's name and flight information.
</ol>
