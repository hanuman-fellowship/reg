Programs
There are 2 new fields in the Misc tab: 
<p>
Discount Code<br>
Discount Percentage
<p>
If these fields are not empty then when someone registers online
for the program (or a PR) they can:
<p>
- enter the Discount Code (for the specific program) (which they've been given by some secret means)<br>
- in the payment description see the % discount is noted
<p>
After paying at authorize.net and after the registration is 'brought in'
there will be a note in the History about the discount
and there will be a negative Charge to reflect the discount.
<p>
Configuration > Affiliations<br>
There is now a new affiliation named 'Website Subscriber'.
This is added when a mailing list request is received.
This affiliation is REMOVED when the person registers for any program.
This was also done retroactively...
Of the 80k people in the database, 
40k had no registrations - 20k of these were Only Temple.
Note that we have not collected temple reservation people
for quite a while.   Shantam's reservation system has
the complete very large set if we wish to communicate with them.
<p>
Rentals > Inquiries<br>
a LOT have come in - some very interesting ones.
where are we advertising? :)<br>
what Google search terms?<br>
I added How Many? as a heading on the list of inquiries so we have an
easy view of the sense of size<br>
I added a field - Status<br>
It currently has 5 values:<p>
- New <br>
- Contacted<br>
- Denied<br>
- Tentative<br>
- Rental<p>
I just made these 5 up.   Let me know what you would like.
You modify the Status by clicking on it.<br>
You update the Notes by clicking on the word 'Notes'.
When an Inquiry is received, a Person record is created (or updated).
You can go to that Person screen by clicking on the Person's name
when viewing the Inquiry.
<p>
Export - you can export all Inquiries to a tab separated file (named inquiry.csv).
The date time format is yyyy-mm-dd hhdd
The delimiter is a tab 
even though the suffix is csv (comma separated values)<br>
You can import this file into Excel/Google Sheets/Numbers (on OSX)<br>
<p>
Make Rental link<br>
This creates a rental from the Inquiry.
Group Name from the Inquiry goes to rental name, title, and badge title
Contact person is set to the leader name from the Inquiry
New Contract and Meeting Place Deposit are checked.
Other fields need to be set - dates, maximum, deposit, etc
Once the rental for the inquiry is created
the 'Make Rental' link changes to 'To Rental'  
and the Status is changed to Rental.
<p>
If you'd like to enter other Inquiries that we previously received by way of
the Google form (' to keep them all in one place ')
you can put the words 'no email' in the What Else?
section and no email will be sent
(and the words 'no email' will be removed).
<p>
There is also the Proposal mechanism that has been in Reg
for quite a while.   It is documented here:<p>
Help > Rentals from Cradle to Grave<p>
This is for purely internal use.  People in the wide world
cannot create a Proposal.   Brajesh wanted it to fill in when
he received a phone call inquiry about a rental.
<p>
Listings > People > General Reports<br>
A new format - 'Name, Address, Email, Affiliations'
This is a tab separated report that downloads into report14.csv
It is similar to Name, Address, Email 
but there is one more field which has the affiliations that matched.
these are comma separated in the one field
these matching affiliations will vary from person to person.
<p>
Green Scene Donations now go to MMC General Donations
for all online registrations (including PRs)<br>
Text on the registration form is from from Lara
there's an MMC logo there as well.
<p>

via the DONATE button
on the mountmadonna.org home page'
