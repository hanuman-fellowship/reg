<h2>Entering Times</h2>
<body>
Times consist of hours and minutes and
can be entered in these formats:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>0325</td><td>24 hour time = 3:25 am</td></tr>
<tr><td>1525</td><td>24 hour time = 3:25 pm</td></tr>
<tr><td>1225</td><td>24 hour time = 12:25 pm</td></tr>
<tr><td>0025</td><td>24 hour time = 12:25 am</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>3:00 defaults to p.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3:25</td><td>3:25 defaults to p.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>325</td><td>3:25 defaults to p.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>9:00 defaults to a.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9:25</td><td>9:25 defaults to a.m.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>10:00 defaults to a.m.</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
To summarize:<br>
If you enter 4 digits it is 24 hour time.
If you enter 1, 2, or 3 digits (or include a colon :) it is 12 hour time
and the convention is that 8 is a.m. and 7 is p.m.
This works because the early morning times and after dinner
is a time when not much is scheduled to start.
Exceptions to this rule can be dealt with by entering 4 digits.
<p>
You CAN also append a 'am' or 'pm' to assert the am/pm status.
