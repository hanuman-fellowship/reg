<h1>People</h1>
Click on 'People.' Shown is a search box, six different ways to search for a person and a choice of how many records per page are displayed.
<p>
Let's hold off on searching for someone for right now. Instead, let's add a make-believe person to Reg and then search for them.
<p>
<h2>Adding People</h2>
Above the 'Searching for People' heading is a link entitled, 'Create.' Click on it. Enter the following: 
<ul>
First name: Papa<br>
Last name: Smurf<br>
Sex: Male<br>
Address: 418 Cedar St.<br>
City: Santa Cruz <br>
State: CA <br>
Zip/Postal Code: 95060<br>
Country: USA<br>
Email: papa@mountmadonna.org<br>
Mailings: Leave all checked<br>
Ambiguous: Leave blank<br>
Home: Leave blank<br>
Work: Leave blank<br>
Cell: (831) 426-1775<br>
Comment: Leave blank<br>
Affiliations: Leave blank <br>
</ul>
(Note that only first and last name and gender are required to add a person to Reg.)
<p>
Click 'Submit'
<p>
ADE: INSERT SCREEN SHOT
<p>
<h3>Required information</h3>
You must enter the following information when adding someone to Reg:
First name, last name, and gender.
If you don't, you will get a message asking you to go back and fix
the error(s). Specifically, if you don't assign the new person a gender,
Reg will both ask you to assign a gender and tell you the likelihood
of the gender, based on the first name you entered.
For example, the name Tony is over ten times more likely
to be a man's name than a woman's. 
<h3>Additional information, incorrect U.S. state</h3>
For U.S. residents, if you enter their street address and city,
Reg will verify the accuracy of the state abbreviation you've entered.
It only verifies state abbreviations for U.S. states and only
if a street address and city is entered.
Reg lets you know you successfully created Papa Smurf. Now let's try the various ways you can search for Mr. Smurf. 
<h2>Searching for People</h2>
<h3>Last name</h3>
Type 'Smurf' and click 'Submit.' Only one person has the last name of Smurf - thankfully - so you are shown Papa Smurf's screen.
<p>
<h3>Partial last name</h3>
Type 'Smu' and click 'Submit.' Every last name that begins with the letters 'smu' will display in list format.
<p>
Searching for first name and partial first name follows the same logic as searching for last name and partial last name. 
<p>
<h3>Last and first name/Partial last and partial first name</h3>
If there were several people with the last name 'Smurf' and you wanted to avoid looking through a long list to find the person you wanted, you can just type 'Smurf Papa' - <b>no comma between last and first name</b> - and go directly to the person's screen you want. (This would be more likely with common names like 'Smith.') 
<p>
Now type 'Smu Pa' and click 'Submit.' Papa Smurf's screen appears because no other person has a last name beginning with 'Smu' and a first name beginning with 'Pa.' 
<p>
However, see what happens when you type, 'Sm Pa.' 
<p>
Had you been looking for a name like Patricia Smith, you would have found her much more quickly this way than by searching solely by 'Smith.'
<p>
This same type of search is possible searching by first, then last, name. Type either 'Papa Smurf' or 'Pa Smu' and click on 'First.' Both times, Papa Smurf's screen pops up because no one else's name matches those attributes.
<p>
<h3>Sanskrit, Zip/Postal Code, Email, Home Phone</h3>
Similar to searching for last and first name, you can also search by Sanskrit name, zip/postal code, email address, or home phone number. This would be helpful if, for example, you remembered someone's colorful email address, but not their name. Something along the lines of cookiemonster@mountmadonna.org, say.
<p>
Note: If you enter a name and nothing in the database matches the name
you entered, you stay at the 'People Search' screen with the following
message:
<quote>
No one found matching 'bumblebee'.
</quote>
The data you entered remains in the search box so that you can easily edit your text.
<h3>Records per page</h3>
Reg automatically displays 15 entries per page.
If you have a feeling the entry you're looking for will not be among
the first 15 entries, you can select how many entries are displayed
per page. This would likely happen with a name like Carol Smith.
Try it! (Of course, if you knew the precise first and last name,
you would just enter it in the search box.) 
<p>
To change the number of records displayed per page, first type the search data, followed by a space, then the number of records per page you'd like to see. 
<p>
For example, type Smith 30 - no comma, just the space - to see 30 entries of 'Smith.' Try it - I'll wait.  See? There's Carol's name on the first page.
<h3>Wildcard search</h3>
This is like the gambling man's search, the "feeling lucky" search.
You would use this search option in the situation where you don't
remember either name of the person you're trying to find,
nor do you remember the first couple of letters of either their
first or last name. All hope is lost, right? 
No (just maybe some of your memory). 
<p>
For example: You want to find someone's profile,
and all you can remember is that they have a unique-sounding name.
This is all you can remember of their last name: R -tz----.
There's an R, T, and Z. Was it Rutz? Ratz? Rootz? 

Do this: Type as much of the name as you remember, substituting an asterisk
for the letters you don't remember. For example: R*tz. 
Note: You don't have to type an asterisk for every letter you don't remember.
If you were to type in R*tz and search by last name, you'd see every last
name that began with 'R' had any number of letters after that,
followed by the letters 'tz'. The 'tz' could or could not be the last
two letters of the name.
<p>
If the name you were looking for was Hank Ratzesberger, congratulations!
That's a hard one to spell, so even if you knew the name but
weren't sure how to spell it, the wildcard search would be helpful.
<h2>Editing a person's profile</h2>
There will come a time when you need to edit someone's profile. Maybe they moved or changed phone numbers or their email address (too much spam sent to their hotmail account). Maybe they want to opt out of our mailings or we want to change their affiliations. 
<p>
As it turns out, Papa Smurf's profile needs to be edited. Let's do it!
<p>
Go to Papa Smurf's screen. Above his name, click on 'Edit.' For ease, change his email address to: papa@theperg.com. And just for fun, click on 'Yoga Teacher Training' under 'Affiliations.' (Turns out, Papa Smurf wants a career change.)
<p>
Now click 'Submit.' You should get the following message: Papa Smurf was updated. And if you go back to his screen, you should see the changes.
<p>
<h2>Partnering</h2>
Just what is partnering, you ask? For example, it turns out that Papa Smurf's common-law wife, Mama Bear wants to be on our mailing list. Because Papa Smurf already receives our mailings, we don't need to send Mama Bear separate mailings. To avoid sending duplicates, we will partner Papa Smurf with Mama Bear.
<p>
Try this. Go to Papa Smurf's screen. Above his name, click on 'Partner With.' You will need to enter Mama Bear's name exactly, <i>with capital letters</i>. Take note that Mama Bear will get Papa Bear's contact information. Click 'Submit.' You will get the following message: Partnered Papa Smurf with Mama Bear.
<p>
If you wanted Papa Smurf and Mama Bear to share <i>Mama Bear's</i> contact information, then you will need to go to Mama Bear's screen and then click on 'Partner With' above her name.
<p>
Note that if you go to either Papa Smurf's or Mama Bear's screen, you will see the note: Partnered with Mama Bear or Papa Smurf, respectively.
<p>
<h2>Separating</h2>
If Papa Smurf and Mama Bear decide to split up, you can go to either one of their screens, click on 'Separate,' then confirm that it is okay to separate them. Each of them can be partnered with someone else.
<p>
<h2>Deleting</h2>
After her divorce from Papa Smurf, Mama Bear has decided that she no longer wishes to receive any information about Mount Madonna Center and, furthermore, will never return to Mount Madonna Center because of the painful memories it conjures up. To delete her from Reg, just click on 'Delete' above her name. Confirm that it is okay to delete 'Mama Bear.' Poof! She is gone. Poor Mama Bear.
<p>
<h1>Creating reports</h1>
<p>
Reports are specific lists of names, addresses, and/or email addresses taken from our mailing list, constrained by specific attributes. For example, a report might list the names and addresses of people who live just within Santa Cruz County and are interested in Ayurvedic programs. Reports can be as inclusive or exclusive as you wish. 
<p>
Try this. Click on 'Reports.' There is a link to add a new report as well as one report titled, 'Ayurveda.' Click on the 'Ayurveda' report. 
<p>
The following information is available about the Ayurveda report:
<ol>
<li>Description (Ayurveda)
<li>Zip Ranges (95060-95062, 95076)
<li>Format (Just Email)
<li>Order by (Zip/Postal code)
<li>Number of Records (left blank to list all records)
<li>Last Run (as of today, blank)
<li>Affiliations (Ayurveda, Herbs & Health)
</ol>
<p>
Above the description of the Ayurveda report is a row of six commands: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Add (adds a new report)
<li>Edit (edits the attributes of the current report)
<li>Delete (deletes the current report)
<li>'Share' checkbox (checking this box limits the report to only those willing to share their information with our business partners)
<li>'Count' checkbox (checking this box will show just the number of people in a report, not their other information)
<li>'Run' (clicking on this will 'run' the numbers if you
</ol>
<p>
Click on 'Share Count' and then 'Run Count' to see the difference in numbers between those people who are willing to share their information with our affiliates and those who are not. 
<p>
Click 'Run.' Listed are the emails of everyone who lives within the zip codes 95060-95062 and 95076. 
<p>
Click 'Share.' This information could be given to someone who wishes to email an advertisement about an Ayurvedic-related program to residents just within those zip codes. (The more restrictive lists are less expensive.)
<p>
Try this. Click on 'Create' under the Reports menu. Enter the following information:
<ul>
Description: Hanuman Temple<br>
Zip Ranges: 95020-95076<br>
Format: Name, Address, Email<br>
Order by: Last name <br>
Number of Records: leave blank.<br>
Affiliations: Click on 'all temple donors'<br>
</ul>
Hit 'Submit.'<br>
<p>
You have created a 'Hanuman Temple' report. For fun, click on 'Run Count.' Reg goes through all the names in our mailing list, picking out just the ones that match the attributes in our report. Out of all of those people, just 13 match those attributes.  Click on 'Run.' Again, in less than a second, Reg has gone through all of the names in our mailing list and listed just the ones that fall within the set zip code ranges and affiliations. 
<p>
<h2>Editing reports</h2>
Now click on 'Edit.' Uncheck the 'all temple donors' affiliation box and click 'Submit.' The attributes of the 'Hanuman Temple' report have updated to reflect this change. Now click on 'Run Count.' That one change significantly increased the number of people within this report. Click on 'Run.' Within a matter of seconds, you see a list of over a thousand people who match the attributes of this report. 
<p>
Okay, fun time is over. Click on 'Delete.' (Yes, it is 'Okay to delete Hanuman Temple.')
<p>
(Order by 'last' means order by 'last name.' That needs to be more clear. 'Search Pattern' under people should change.)
<p>
<h2>People, Affiliations, Unduplication, Reports</h2>
<h3>Search</h3>
Enter pattern after 'Search For' and  press Submit.
The pattern is actually a 'prefix' of the last name.
You will be shown the first 15 people whose last names
match the pattern.  Upper/lower case does not matter
in the pattern.
<p>
Try searching by Sanskrit, Zip, Email, First, and Home Phone.
The numbers in home phone are not necessarily sequential.
This is okay if you give the full 10 digits
otherwise it is sort of weird - but useful nonetheless.
If the pattern is quoted:
<ul>
'1432'<br>
or<br>
'460-'
</ul>
then it *will* match sequential digits.
<p>
None found? You stay at the search screen.
Your search pattern is preserved so you can easily correct it.
<p>

If there are more search results than will fit on the
page - Try 'Next' until there are no more.
There is also 'Prev'.   Note that the position of the Next and Prev
do not change so your mouse can stay in one place.
<p>
If you wish to see more than the default 15 records per page
you can append a number to the pattern.  Like so:
<ul>
smith 30
</ul>
If there is only one person found that person will be
shown immediately.  No separate step with
a list containing just one person.
<p>
If searching by Last Name you can give
two strings separated by a space.  The first string
will be matched against the last name field and the
second will be matched against the first name field.
And vica versa if you're searching by First.
This can speed the finding by a lot!
<p>
If there is a star '*' in a pattern it will be a 'wildcard'
so you can find people whose names _contain_ the pattern
but not necessarily as a prefix.
E.g. searching for '*ete' will find people whose last name
is 'Peterson' and searching for '*ete *re' will find
'Demeter, Karen'.  The '*' can be in the middle as
well - 'r*z' will find a last name of 'Ratzenberger'.
<h3>Add a Person</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill in all fields (country defaults to USA).
<li>Choose a few affiliations.
<li>Note the two submit buttons (for convenience's sake).
<li>After creation there is a message in red with the person's name.
<li>Click on it to return to their info.
<li>Verify the date of entry.
<li>Give an incorrect State (in the U.S.).
<li>Leave sex unchosen - get error.
Note that the gender is guessed at for you
by consulting www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php.
</ol>
<h3>Quick Access Keys</h3>
You can use the keyboard to invoke various functions
rather than the mouse if you wish.  It might be faster for you.
This is very browser dependent.
On Firefox you press Shift-Alt and the letter key below.
On Safari you press Control.
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>A</td><td>Add</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>Donation</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Edit</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>Leader (make or info)</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td><td>Member (make or info)</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>Next page of results (when viewing search results)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>Prev page of results (when viewing search results)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>make Payment</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Partner With (partner with or view partner)</td></tr>
<tr><td>R</td><td>Register</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>Search</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Undup</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Note that these letters have a subtle light blue background.
<p>
Also note that after search results are shown the first person
has the focus so you can just hit Return to see their information.
In the list the Tab key will take you to subsequent names in the list.
This is nice for the mouse-averse.
<h3>Affiliations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on Configuration/Affiliations at the top.
<li>Edit one.
<li>Create one.
<li>Go to edit a person again and verify that
the edited affliation and the new one are there.
<li>Add the new affiliation to several people.
<li>Go back to affiliation, delete the new one.
<li>Verify it is gone from the people.
<li>And from the list when editing a person.
</ol>
<h3>Miscellaneous People Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Find someone to Delete.<br>
See confirmation dialog.
Verify they were deleted.
<li>Find someone to Edit.<br>
Make a change.
Submit and see the 'updated' message.  Click on the person's name
to see their info.
Verify the date of updating
<li>Map<br>
There is a link at the top named 'Map'.
It jumps to Google maps using the person's address.
Cool?  Yes.  Useful?  Maybe.
<li>Create a duplicate record.<br>
See the warning about <i>possible</i> dups.
It could be exactly same name
or a similar address with first and last initials the same like this:
<ul>
Joe Smith   123 Orange St Tampa, FL 34510<br>
Joseph Smith 123 Orange Street Tampa, FL 34510<br>
</ul>
<p>
Similar dup checks are done after an update of an existing record
(rather than a new creation).  Verify this.
<li>Partners<br>
Partners in this context are used mostly to reduce mailing costs.
Any two people who want to be partnered can simply request it.
Any one who does not want to be partnered any more can simply request
it and it will be done - poof.
<ol>
<li>Choose a person (that is not partnered).
<li>Note the link that says 'Partner With'.
<li>Click on it.
<li>You're asked for a first and last name.
<li>Enter an existing person.  You must spell it exactly.
The two are partnered and their records
now say 'Partnered with ...' - You can click on the
link to go to the partner.
<li>Or enter a person's name that is not in the mailing list.
You will be notified that it is new and will be asked to confirm
the partnering.  If yes, it proceeds.  If not, it is cancelled.
Note the message in either case.
<li>Confirm that the new partner gets the mailing address and home
phone of the original person.
<li>There is 'Separate'.</li>
<ol type=a>
<li>Separate two partners - note the confirmation dialog.
<li>Verify they are no longer partnered.
<li>Delete one of a partnership and note that the undeleted partner
is now no longer partnered.
<li>Edit the address or home phone of a partnered person
and verify that these fields of their partner are updated as well.
and that each person's 'last updated' date is changed to today.
</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
<h3>Unduplication</h3>
Under Listings you will find a link 'Unduplication File'.
This gives a list of <i>possible</i> duplicates.  Since this
list is quite long it is best to
generate it once, save it, and use it to do research.
It shows:<p>
<ol>
<li>Identical first/last names.<br>
Click on one of the names to be taken to an unduplication dialog
for the two people.
If there are 3 or more people with the same name it is better
to do a search for them by last/first name.  You'll know there
are 3 or more if two names in a row in this undup
list are the same.
<li>Unpartnered people with addresses that are 'numerically' close.</li>
For example:<p>
<ul>
123 Orange St Tampa, FL 12341<br>
and<br>
123 Ornge Street Tampa, FL 12341<br>
</ul>
are numerically close.
Clicking on one of these people will also bring you to
the unduplication dialog.
<p>
After a normal search you may see several people who are
in actuality, the same person.  
Searches by last name will reveal some possible duplicates.
Also try using email address.
The process of UNduplicating
these people is tricky and there's a link 'Undup' to help.
This brings you, again, to the unduplication dialog.
<li>Unreported Gender</li>
Also in the unduplication file listing are those with undetermined gender.
(These are not dups but this is as good a place as any to
show this information).  The names in the list
are actually links - they'll take you to the person's
screen.   The gender is guessed at using a special
<a href="http://www.gpeters.com/names/baby-names.php">web site</a>.
If it looks obvious which gender it should be you can click on the
'Male' or 'Female' link and the gender will be changed.
(Easier than doing edit, click, submit...).
</ol>
<h3>The Unduplication Dialog</h3>
This dialog presents you with complete demographic information.
This also includes the email address, home phone, last date of updating
the person record, how many registrations this person has
(after the name in parens), and whether they're a leader, partner or member.
<p>
You can <i>narrow down</i> which people you see in the dialog by putting 'n'
(lower n for narrow) in the text field next to the people's
names you wish to see.  Press Submit and the non-n people will
be removed to make your decision process easier.
The order of the people is not guaranteed to be the same on the next screen.
<p>
When you have identified who should be merged into whom
put a 'P' (capital P for primary) on the person you want to keep
and an 'm' (lower m for merge) on the people you want to merge
into the primary.  Registrations, donations and credits from
the merged people will be added to the primary person.
Any affiliation, leader or member information for the
merged people will be completely deleted.   A partner of a merged
person will become unpartnered but will be preserved.
<p>
If you see the person and their potential <i>partner</i> on the same screen
you can partner them right here.  Put P and p next to their names.
The p person will be partnered with the P person taking their
address and home phone.  You can't do merging and partnering
at the same time.
<h3>General Reports</h3>
General Reports are found under 'Listings' at the top of the right column.
This is where you can select a subset of all People and produce
nice listings of selected attributes.
<ol>
<li>Create a report - giving a description and some zip code range.
For 'Format' choose 'Name, Address, Email'.
For 'Order By' choose 'Last Name' or 'Zip/Postal Code'.
<li>Run the report.   See the rows on the screen. 
The report can be printed directly or saved, if needed.
<li>Change 'Format' to 'Email to VistaPrint' and re-run.
<li>If you click on the 'Count' button rather than 'Run' you'll get
a count of how many records <i>will</i> appear in the report
when it is run.
<li>Change 'Number of Records' to something non-zero and less than the count.
ReRun.   This is a random sample of the prior listing's rows.
This is useful when we are selling our list to associated
organizations and they don't want to pay for the whole thing.
<li>Edit the report and select some affiliations.
Now the listing is restricted to people who
have at least one of the affiliations in their record.
<li>Add one of the affiliations to a person not in the
report and verify they now do appear in the rerunning of the report.
If 'Mailings-Snail Mail' is UNchecked the person will not be
included in any report where the postal address is included.
If 'Mailings-Email' is UNchecked the person will similarily not be
included in any report where the email address appears.
<p>
There is also the Person attribute 'Inactive'.
No inactive people should be included in any Report regardless
of their Mailings setting.
Note that when someone is marked 'Deceased' they automatically
become 'Inactive'.
<li>Choose a format of 'Just Email'.
Only people with non-blank emails will be included.
Sorted by email.
<li>Try an invalid zip code range.  Make some mistakes.
Try several zip code ranges in the one field - like this:
<ul>
95060-95062, 89012-89450, 01234
</ul>
<li>Verify you can delete reports.
<li>In the formats other than 'Just Email' note that if both
partners make it into the report
then the partners will be coalesced/merged/joined
into a single record.  Note the different name
that is displayed - if the partners have the same
last name it is not repeated:
<ul>
Mary Smith & John Doe<br>
Penny & Charlie Trager
</ul>
A weakness I just noticed - Partners don't necessarily
have the same work or cell number.
In the Format listing where there are the 3 phone numbers
there is only one work and cell number.
Hmmm.  Not a big problem but not right, either.
<li>If you check 'Share' the report will only include
people that have indicated they permit us to share
their demographic information with business associates.
This is the 'Mailings-Share' checkbox on the Person record.
The count of these people is obviously less than without
'Share' clicked.
<li>If you click 'Collapse' and then 'Run Report'
all people with the same address will be collapsed into one line
whether they are partners or not.  One of the names will be 
chosen to represent the others and this name will be suffixed with 'et. al.'
<li>If you click 'Include MMC' (which is UNclicked by default)
then people whose address is 445 Summit Rd, Watsonville, CA 95076
<i>will</i> be included in the count and report - otherwise they
will <i>not</i> be included.   This is useful for when
you need a count to know how many items to have printed but
do not want to send them through the mail because you want
to put them in people's mailboxes at the center yourself.
<p>
Note that to find out which people at MMC are included
you can run the report and do a search within the resultant 
web page for "445 Sum". 
<li>Try the other report formats.
Try 'Name, Address, Link'
and see the link on the person's name - it takes
you to viewing that person's full record.
</ol>

<h3>Extra Accounts & Payments</h3>
Add an 'Extra Account' in Configuration.
Go to a person's screen and make a 'Payment' into that extra account.
See the list of payments on the person's screen near the bottom.
<p>
<h3>Projects & Donations</h3>
Ditto the above with projects and donations.
One difference between donations and payments
is that payments are included in the deposit but donations are not.
<h3>Registrations</h3>
All of the person's Registrations are listed on the person's page
with the Program name and the start date.   Click on program
name to go to that person's registration for that program.
This is shown only if one of your roles is 'Program Staff'.
<p>
If a person has cancelled a registration and received
a credit this, too, is listed on their page.
