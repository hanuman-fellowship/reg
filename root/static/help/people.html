<h1>People</h1>
Click on 'People.' Shown is a search box, six different ways to search for a person and a choice of how many records per page are displayed.
<p>
Let's hold off on searching for someone for right now. Instead, let's add a make-believe person to Reg and then search for them.
<p>
<h2>Adding People</h2>
Above the 'Searching for People' heading is a link entitled, 'Create.' Click on it. Enter the following: 
<ul>
First name: Papa<br>
Last name: Smurf<br>
Sex: Male<br>
Address: 418 Cedar St.<br>
City: Santa Cruz <br>
State: CA <br>
Zip/Postal Code: 95060<br>
Country: USA<br>
Email: papa@mountmadonna.org<br>
Mailings: Leave all checked<br>
Ambiguous: Leave blank<br>
Home: Leave blank<br>
Work: Leave blank<br>
Cell: (831) 426-1775<br>
Comment: Leave blank<br>
Affiliations: Leave blank <br>
</ul>
(Note that only first and last name and gender are required to add a person to Reg.)
<p>
Click 'Submit'
<p>
ADE: INSERT SCREEN SHOT
<p>
<h3>Required information</h3>
You must enter the following information when adding someone to Reg:
First name, last name, and gender.
If you don't, you will get a message asking you to go back and fix
the error(s). Specifically, if you don't assign the new person a gender,
Reg will both ask you to assign a gender and tell you the likelihood
of the gender, based on the first name you entered.
For example, the name Tony is over ten times more likely
to be a man's name than a woman's. 
<h3>Additional information, incorrect U.S. state</h3>
For U.S. residents, if you enter their street address and city,
Reg will verify the accuracy of the state abbreviation you've entered.
It only verifies state abbreviations for U.S. states and only
if a street address and city is entered.
Reg lets you know you successfully created Papa Smurf. Now let's try the various ways you can search for Mr. Smurf. 
<h2>Searching for People</h2>
<h3>Last name</h3>
Type 'Smurf' and click 'Submit.' Only one person has the last name of Smurf - thankfully - so you are shown Papa Smurf's screen.
<p>
<h3>Partial last name</h3>
Type 'Smu' and click 'Submit.' Every last name that begins with the letters 'smu' will display in list format.
<p>
Searching for first name and partial first name follows the same logic as searching for last name and partial last name. 
<p>
<h3>Last and first name/Partial last and partial first name</h3>
If there were several people with the last name 'Smurf' and you wanted to avoid looking through a long list to find the person you wanted, you can just type 'Smurf Papa' - <b>no comma between last and first name</b> - and go directly to the person's screen you want. (This would be more likely with common names like 'Smith.') 
<p>
Now type 'Smu Pa' and click 'Submit.' Papa Smurf's screen appears because no other person has a last name beginning with 'Smu' and a first name beginning with 'Pa.' 
<p>
However, see what happens when you type, 'Sm Pa.' 
<p>
Had you been looking for a name like Patricia Smith, you would have found her much more quickly this way than by searching solely by 'Smith.'
<p>
This same type of search is possible searching by first, then last, name. Type either 'Papa Smurf' or 'Pa Smu' and click on 'First.' Both times, Papa Smurf's screen pops up because no one else's name matches those attributes.
<p>
<h3>Sanskrit, Zip/Postal Code, Email, Home Phone</h3>
Similar to searching for last and first name, you can also search by Sanskrit name, zip/postal code, email address, or home phone number. This would be helpful if, for example, you remembered someone's colorful email address, but not their name. Something along the lines of cookiemonster@mountmadonna.org, say.
<p>
Note: If you enter a name and nothing in the database matches the name
you entered, you stay at the 'People Search' screen with the following
message:
<quote>
No one found matching 'bumblebee'.
</quote>
The data you entered remains in the search box so that you can easily edit your text.
<h3>Records per page</h3>
Reg automatically displays 15 entries per page.
If you have a feeling the entry you're looking for will not be among
the first 15 entries, you can select how many entries are displayed
per page. This would likely happen with a name like Carol Smith.
Try it! (Of course, if you knew the precise first and last name,
you would just enter it in the search box.) 
<p>
To change the number of records displayed per page, first type the search data, followed by a space, then the number of records per page you'd like to see. 
<p>
For example, type Smith 30 - no comma, just the space - to see 30 entries of 'Smith.' Try it - I'll wait.  See? There's Carol's name on the first page.
<h3>Wildcard search</h3>
This is like the gambling man's search, the "feeling lucky" search.
You would use this search option in the situation where you don't
remember either name of the person you're trying to find,
nor do you remember the first couple of letters of either their
first or last name. All hope is lost, right? 
No (just maybe some of your memory). 
<p>
For example: You want to find someone's profile,
and all you can remember is that they have a unique-sounding name.
This is all you can remember of their last name: R -tz----.
There's an R, T, and Z. Was it Rutz? Ratz? Rootz? 

Do this: Type as much of the name as you remember, substituting an asterisk
for the letters you don't remember. For example: R*tz. 
Note: You don't have to type an asterisk for every letter you don't remember.
If you were to type in R*tz and search by last name, you'd see every last
name that began with 'R' had any number of letters after that,
followed by the letters 'tz'. The 'tz' could or could not be the last
two letters of the name.
<p>
If the name you were looking for was Hank Ratzesberger, congratulations!
That's a hard one to spell, so even if you knew the name but
weren't sure how to spell it, the wildcard search would be helpful.
<h2>Editing a person's profile</h2>
There will come a time when you need to edit someone's profile. Maybe they moved or changed phone numbers or their email address (too much spam sent to their hotmail account). Maybe they want to opt out of our mailings or we want to change their affiliations. 
<p>
As it turns out, Papa Smurf's profile needs to be edited. Let's do it!
<p>
Go to Papa Smurf's screen. Above his name, click on 'Edit.' For ease, change his email address to: papa@theperg.com. And just for fun, click on 'Yoga Teacher Training' under 'Affiliations.' (Turns out, Papa Smurf wants a career change.)
<p>
Now click 'Submit.' You should get the following message: Papa Smurf was updated. And if you go back to his screen, you should see the changes.
<p>
<h2>Partnering</h2>
Just what is partnering, you ask? For example, it turns out that Papa Smurf's common-law wife, Mama Bear wants to be on our mailing list. Because Papa Smurf already receives our mailings, we don't need to send Mama Bear separate mailings. To avoid sending duplicates, we will partner Papa Smurf with Mama Bear.
<p>
Try this. Go to Papa Smurf's screen. Above his name, click on 'Partner With.' You will need to enter Mama Bear's name exactly, <i>with capital letters</i>. Take note that Mama Bear will get Papa Bear's contact information. Click 'Submit.' You will get the following message: Partnered Papa Smurf with Mama Bear.
<p>
If you wanted Papa Smurf and Mama Bear to share <i>Mama Bear's</i> contact information, then you will need to go to Mama Bear's screen and then click on 'Partner With' above her name.
<p>
Note that if you go to either Papa Smurf's or Mama Bear's screen, you will see the note: Partnered with Mama Bear or Papa Smurf, respectively.
<p>
<h2>Separating</h2>
If Papa Smurf and Mama Bear decide to split up, you can go to either one of their screens, click on 'Separate,' then confirm that it is okay to separate them. Each of them can be partnered with someone else.
<p>
<h2>Deleting</h2>
After her divorce from Papa Smurf, Mama Bear has decided that she no longer wishes to receive any information about Mount Madonna Center and, furthermore, will never return to Mount Madonna Center because of the painful memories it conjures up. To delete her from Reg, just click on 'Delete' above her name. Confirm that it is okay to delete 'Mama Bear.' Poof! She is gone. Poor Mama Bear.
<p>
<h1>Creating reports</h1>
<p>
Reports are specific lists of names, addresses, and/or email addresses taken from our mailing list, constrained by specific attributes. For example, a report might list the names and addresses of people who live just within Santa Cruz County and are interested in Ayurvedic programs. Reports can be as inclusive or exclusive as you wish. 
<p>
Try this. Click on 'Reports.' There is a link to add a new report as well as one report titled, 'Ayurveda.' Click on the 'Ayurveda' report. 
<p>
The following information is available about the Ayurveda report:
<ol>
<li>Description (Ayurveda)
<li>Zip Ranges (95060-95062, 95076)
<li>Format (Just Email)
<li>Order by (Zip/Postal code)
<li>Number of Records (left blank to list all records)
<li>Last Run (as of today, blank)
<li>Affiliations (Ayurveda, Herbs & Health)
</ol>
<p>
Above the description of the Ayurveda report is a row of six commands: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Add (adds a new report)
<li>Edit (edits the attributes of the current report)
<li>Delete (deletes the current report)
<li>'Share' checkbox (checking this box limits the report to only those willing to share their information with our business partners)
<li>'Count' checkbox (checking this box will show just the number of people in a report, not their other information)
<li>'Run' (clicking on this will 'run' the numbers if you
</ol>
<p>
Click on 'Share Count' and then 'Run Count' to see the difference in numbers between those people who are willing to share their information with our affiliates and those who are not. 
<p>
Click 'Run.' Listed are the emails of everyone who lives within the zip codes 95060-95062 and 95076. 
<p>
Click 'Share.' This information could be given to someone who wishes to email an advertisement about an Ayurvedic-related program to residents just within those zip codes. (The more restrictive lists are less expensive.)
<p>
Try this. Click on 'Create' under the Reports menu. Enter the following information:
<ul>
Description: Hanuman Temple<br>
Zip Ranges: 95020-95076<br>
Format: Name, Address, Email<br>
Order by: Last name <br>
Number of Records: leave blank.<br>
Affiliations: Click on 'all temple donors'<br>
</ul>
Hit 'Submit.'<br>
<p>
You have created a 'Hanuman Temple' report. For fun, click on 'Run Count.' Reg goes through all the names in our mailing list, picking out just the ones that match the attributes in our report. Out of all of those people, just 13 match those attributes.  Click on 'Run.' Again, in less than a second, Reg has gone through all of the names in our mailing list and listed just the ones that fall within the set zip code ranges and affiliations. 
<p>
<h2>Editing reports</h2>
Now click on 'Edit.' Uncheck the 'all temple donors' affiliation box and click 'Submit.' The attributes of the 'Hanuman Temple' report have updated to reflect this change. Now click on 'Run Count.' That one change significantly increased the number of people within this report. Click on 'Run.' Within a matter of seconds, you see a list of over a thousand people who match the attributes of this report. 
<p>
Okay, fun time is over. Click on 'Delete.' (Yes, it is 'Okay to delete Hanuman Temple.')
<p>
(Order by 'last' means order by 'last name.' That needs to be more clear. 'Search Pattern' under people should change.)
