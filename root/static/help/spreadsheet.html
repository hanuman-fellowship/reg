The first row of the spreadsheet needs to be a header row.<br>
These column headers are required to be present (but not necessarily in this order):
<ul>
first, last, address, city, state, zip, country, phone, email
</ul>
These are optional:
<ul>
address2, company
</ul>
If a required header is missing the upload will be abandoned with an error message.
<p>
The letter case of the header string is ignored so<br>
<ul>
First, first, or FIRST
</ul>
are all okay.
<p>
We only look for a substring that matches so
<ul>
Zipcode
</ul>
will be accepted for 'zip'.
