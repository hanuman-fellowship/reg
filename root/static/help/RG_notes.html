Rental Inquiry
    Questions.
    adding questions for initial inquiry
        single checkbox - two question texts?
    How do I view the inquiry form?
        where is the email sent?

Suggest Feature
    lots of suggestions
    most are 'awaiting feedback'
        what are the things currently being developed?

Add Team Member 
    Permissions - only Renter, Registrar, Viewonly, Owner
        what do these limitations mean?
    Can't add anyone new. It says "That username already exists"
        not true
        is this a limitation of the sandbox?

Add Person
    the display of all is very dynamic - cool but quickly is unusable
        if you have too many columns
    what if there are 10,000 people?
        how many shown?
    Inevitably I compare it to Reg
    edit person, scroll down... must scroll up to click 'Update'

Not much fun... I may ask to be paid.
    OR I may decline.

    Of course, RG wants to give the impression that
    all is easy and obvious and convenient and friendly
