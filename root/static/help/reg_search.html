<h2>Searching for Registrations</h2>
There are two search fields - one for the Registrant
and one for the Program.
<p>
In the Registrant field you can put a prefix of the last
name and, if you wish, a prefix of the first name.
<p>
In the Program field put a prefix of the program name.
If you want to search for people in the current program
just leave this field blank.
<p>
For example:
<ul>
Registant: ar c<br>
Program: av
</ul>
This searches for people whose last name begins with &lsquo;ar&rsquo;
and whose first name begins with &lsquo;c&rsquo; - in programs whose
name begins with &lsquo;av&rsquo;.
<p>
In both fields you can include a star &lsquo;*&rsquo; - for wildcard matching.
<ul>
Registant: *son<br>
Program:
</ul>
The above will look for people in the current program with &lsquo;son&rsquo;
in their last name <u>somewhere</u>.
