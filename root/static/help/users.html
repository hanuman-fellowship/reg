<h2>Users, Passwords and Roles</h2>
Users log in to Reg with a name and password.
<p>
If the user is inactive for 2 hours their session will be terminated and
they will need to log in again.
<p>
The password can be changed by choosing Configuration/Password, Name, Email.
The dialog can also be used to change your first and last names
and email address.  Your login name cannot be changed.
<p>
The key to achieving some level of system security is
having passwords that are hard to guess.
Enforcing password complexity
is a simple way to ensure a minimum level of security.
The level of password complexity can be changed by the super_admin
by modifying the String 'password_security'.
It can be either 0, 1, or 2.
<ol start=0>
<li>No restrictions at all on the password.<br>
<li>The password must be at least 4 characters
    and not contain only lower case letters.<br>
<li>The password must be at least 6 characters and must
    contain a lower case letter, an upper case letter,
    a digit, and a punctuation character.
</ol>
