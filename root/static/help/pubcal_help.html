This is how to navigate the MMC calendar of future events:
<p>
To the right of each month name there are yearly jump images.
Hovering over them you will see month names.  When you click
you will jump to that month.  This can be easier than scrolling.
<p>
There are 'Details' checkboxes with which you
can get more details of the events in that month.
