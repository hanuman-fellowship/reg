<h2>Distributed Demographic Update</h2>
This document describes a mechanism within Reg that
makes it very easy to keep everyone's address, email, phone numbers,
etcetera up to date.  This is done by requesting that people to do it <i>themselves</i>.
This <u>distributes</u> the clerical burden of our staff and reduces the risk
of typos and errors.
<ol>
<li>The process is begun by Adding a Report (Listings &gt; People &gt; General Reports)
with a format of type 'Email, Code' or 'Address, Code'.
'Email, Code' is used for making the requests by email.
'Address, Code' is used when sending requests by snail mail.
<p>
The other attributes of the Report are up to you.
They select a subset of all people by restricting the zip code, the affiliations,
and/or the date of last contact.
In both cases, people who are Inactive will not be included in the report's output.
