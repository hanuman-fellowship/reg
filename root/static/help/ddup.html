<h2>Distributed Demographic Update</h2>
This document describes a mechanism within Reg that
makes it very easy to keep everyone's address, email, phone numbers,
et cetera up to date.  This is done by requesting that people to do it <i>themselves</i>.
This <u>distributes</u> the clerical burden of our staff and reduces the risk
of typos and errors.
<ol>
<li>The process (nicknamed DDUP) is begun by Adding a Report (Listings &gt; People &gt; General Reports)
with a format of type:
<span class=code>Email, Code</span>
or
<span class=code>Address, Code</span>.
<p>
<span class=code>Email, Code</span> is used
for making the requests by email.  The report output
contains the following fields:
First, Last, Email, Secure Code
<p>
<span class=code>Address, Code</span> is used
when sending requests by snail mail.  The report output includes these fields:
First, Last, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip, Country, Secure Code.
<p>
The other attributes of the Report are up to you.
You can select a subset of all people by restricting
the zip code, the affiliations,
and/or the date of last contact.
People who are Inactive will not be included in the report's output.
Also note that there is no restriction based on
the people's mailing preferences - since this is a request
for them to update those preferences.
<li>
You can ask for a Count of the report to see if it is of the size you wish.
<p>
When you wish to Run these reports you will need to supply
an Expiration Date (in the usual format: see <a href=dates.html>Dates</a>).
<p>
<b>Important</b>: The output of the reports should be saved in a file for sending
to the mailing services (Mail Chimp and CMS).
Use 'File > Save As' in your browser.
<p>
The act of running the report will export/upload all the demographic data for
the chosen people
to a secure place on mountmadonna.org.  You will receive an email
about the status of the upload (hopefully it will say Success).
<li>
Going to the Listings > People > General Reports page
(might as well make a bookmark for this page, eh?) you will see
a line like this:
<pre>
Distributed Update: Expires Jun 25 0 viewed, 0 changed - imported 0 of 223 = 0% Import New See Log
</pre>
This status line shows what has been happening.
<p>
Viewed - the # of people who clicked on the link but made no change.<br>
Changed -  the # of people who made some kind of change.<br>
Imported - How many people's changes have been imported so far?
The percentage is calculated as well so you can see what level
of feedback you're getting from the requests for demographic updates.
<p>
'Import New' and 'See Log' are links. 
<p>
'See Log' will show you a timestamped log of what has
happened with the DDUP process.  You'll see when the exports
(uploadings) happened,
what changes people made, and what imports (see below) happened as well.
On that page you can choose 'Clear Log' to
start fresh.  There's also 'Reports' to go back to the list of reports.
<p>
'Import New' will take all the latest changes that were made
on mountmadonna.org and import them into Reg.  This act is logged.
You can do this import incrementally several times before the expiration date.
<li>
Using Mail Chimp (for <span class=code>Email, Code</span> or Complete Mailing Service for <span class=code>Address, Code</span>) you take the saved
report file and do a mail merge.    The body of the emails you send
should be something like this:
<pre>
Greetings FIRST,

MMC wants to be sure we have your current information
such as address, phone, mailing preferences, etc.
Click &lt;a href='https://www.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/update?code=CODE'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see and update it.

Thank you,
MMC
</pre>
Your email will be worded much better, of course.
The Secure Code field in your saved data file will be used for the CODE above.
<li>
The people who receive the email will click on the link
and see their information.  They can change these things:
<p>
First, Last, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip, Country.
Email address.  Sex (gender). Cell, Home, and Work phone numbers.
<p>
There is a section entitled 'Your Interests' which includes
the affiliations that begin (in Reg) with 'PROGRAMS -'.  The
'PROGRAMS -' prefix will be removed so the person will only see the rest of the
affiliation name.
This list is currently (6/25/17) like so:
<pre>
Art 
Ayurveda, Herbs & Health
Buddhist
Jewish
Meditation
Men's Programs
Movement  
Music
Personal Growth
Personal Retreats
Women's Programs
Yoga
Yoga Teacher Training
</pre>
<p>
The mailing preferences section looks like this:
<pre>
_ Yes, send me occasional e-mail announcements about MMC.
_ Yes, send me postcards and brochures in the mail about MMC.
_ Yes, send me occasional e-mail announcements about MMI. What is MMI?
_ Yes, send me postcards and brochures in the mail about MMI.
_ You may share my address with MMC affiliates.
</pre>
<p>
After checking and updating any or all of this
the person will click on one of two buttons:
<pre>
1 - Submit the changes I made

2 - No changes are needed - It all looks Just Fine.
</pre>
In the first case we present a summary of what
their information looks like now and we give them
an opportunity to ReEdit it.   Or they can choose 'Looks Good'
which takes them to the home page of MMC.
<p>
The second case is Just Fine and they're again taken directly to the MMC home page.
<li>
If a nefarious hacker tries to break our system we
have some protections built in.  If the cgi-bin/update program
detects an illegal CODE it will give an error message and keep
track of who submitted it.  If too many failures have
happened (currently more than 5)
an email is sent to jonb@logicalpoetry.com (who else?)
and the person is notified
of their transgressions and they are BLOCKED (for 5 minutes).
<p>
This system can be tweaked as needed.
<li>
When the expiration date has passed people will no longer
be able to update their demographic data.  At this point we
can go to any report with one of the two Code formats and choose the link 
'Clobber Current Distributed Update'.
Then you can Run another one.
<p>
When doing the 'Run Report', another option is to Append
to the existing records that have been exported.  The expiration
date has to be the same as the currently active one.
<li>
For DDUP reports that use <span class=code>Address, Code</span>
you can have CMS put the CODE on the mailing label somewhere.
Within the text of the mailing item (brochure, flyer, card, etc)
you can direct people to go to this web address:
<pre>
    <a target=_blank href='https://www.mountmadonna.org/update'>mountmadonna.org/update</a>
</pre>
At this site (click it above to see) you can enter your CODE
and proceed as before.
This page needs styling attention - as do the other pages as well!.
The other pages are in the cgi-bin directory and are named
update.tt2, update2.tt2, update_msg.tt2, and update_expired.tt2.
They are not generated by Craft.
