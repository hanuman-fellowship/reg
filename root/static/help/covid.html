<h1>COVID-19 Vaccinations</h1>
Starting on September 1, 2021 everyone coming to MMC
is required to have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19.
<p>
This requirement affects Programs and Rentals in different ways.
<p>
Rental coordinators (the Contact Person and/or the Contract Signer)
are tasked with verifying that the people they invite have been
fully vaccinated.  This involves a level of trust.
<p>
Programs that are ONLINE are, of course, exempt from the vaccination
requirement because the attendees will not be at MMC.
<p>
Programs that will meet at MMC (including Personal Retreats and Special Guests)
<i>will</i> require that the registrants prove that they have been
fully vaccinated.  This means that they will need to upload an image
of their vaccination card.
<p>
The starting point is the 'COVID Vaccination Required' attribute on the
Misc tab of Programs.
Turning that on will trigger other things - like the little black 'v' next
to the program title in the list of programs.  The little green 'w' means
that the program is 'web ready' and will be exported to mountmadonna.org.
