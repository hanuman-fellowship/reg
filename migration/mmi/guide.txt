1.  We should first merge the MMI list, then the Campaigner list

2.  If the contact does not exist in Reg, create a new Person
    with the contact information available in the Excel list.

3.  Affiliations

    1.  MMI List: For newly created Persons in Reg, make sure
        they are affiliated with "MMI-Ayurveda"

    2.  Campaigner List: Merge affiliations using the "Receive_info_about"
        column as follows:

        1.  If the value is “all schools” or there is no value, affiliate
            the Person in Reg with all the MMI affiliations (Ayurveda,
            Community studies, consultations, massage, yoga)
        2.   “ayurveda” maps to "MMI-Ayurveda" and "MMI-Consultations".
        3.   "community studies" maps to "MMI - Community Studies"
        4.   "massage" maps to "MMI – Massage"
        5.  "yoga" maps to "MMI – Yoga"

4.  Mailing preferences

    1.  MMI List: For each contact in the MMI list, the corresponding
        Person in Reg should be subscribed to the MMI email and snail
        mail list.

    2.  Campaigner List: Merge email preferences using the "Status" column
        as follows:

        1.  If a person is listed as "unsubscribe"
            make sure the corresponding Person in Reg is unsubscribed
            from the MMI email list.
            If a person is listed as "hardbounced" replace the email
            with an empty string.

        2.  If a person is listed as "softbounced" or "available",
             make sure they are subscribed to the MMI email list.
