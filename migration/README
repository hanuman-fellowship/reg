make the tables with:

sqlite3 retreatcenter.db <mktables

import the data with:

perl load.pl

there will be a few error messages about
erroneous affiliations.

the migrated data is in these files which
are read by load.pl:

affils
people
reports

The reports schema is wide open for change and improvement.

The format column is an integer representing
one of 11 different formats:

    1  = "Name|Address|Email"
    2  = "Email to CMS"
    3  = "Name, Address"
    4  = "Name, Home #, Work #"
    5  = "Name, Home #, Work # - double spaced"
    6  = "Name, Home #"
    7  = "Count"
    8  = "DBF format"
    9  = "Statistics"
    10 = "Just Name"
    11 = "Name, Email"

The rep_order column is a single letter for
sorting on various columns in people:

    Z zip_post
    N last name
    S sanskrit name

The affils column is space separated integers
representing foreign keys into the affils table.
Bogus, yes.   It's due to the transforming of
affils from letters to a mapping table.

I would be quite fine with forcing the users
to recreate the reports in your new format whatever
it is.  No big deal.  So no real need to migrate this data.
Just learn from it what the range of things the old
one could do.

One nice thing for the new would a column named 'nrecs'.
The program would do the query and then
take a random sample (at a certain probablity)
to generate approximately nrecs records.
I can explain further if needed.

Perhaps a way to give a date and specify which 
of the 5 dates in people to compare it to.
Like select * from people where date_updat > '2006-01-01'.

The minimum requirement is to be able
to give zip code ranges and a series of affiliations.
And to specify the output format.

You can experiment and enhance it if you wish.
You might ask Brajesh or Jayanti if they see
any particular needs beyond what they have now.
