<h2>Reg</h2>
<ol>
<li>Schema design EXcluding housing.<br>
Computerized Housing <u>can</u> be designed later and inserted.<br>
It's hard enough without housing!<br>
What about Rentals?  Regi??  In same table?
<li>Program CRUD, migration of all programs.<br>
Web/Brochure descriptions in textarea - not on separate dialog.<br>
Upload of program image file.<br>
Validations.
<li>Leader CRUD, linking to Program.<br>
Biography in text area, upload of leader image file.
<li>Cancellation Policy CRUD, linking to Program.
<li>Housing Costs CRUD, linking to Program.
<li>Rentals CRUD - different from Program CRUD.
<li>Registration CRUD linking to Programs.
<ol type=a>
<li>Search for Program, Person - coordinated efficiently somehow.
<li>This can be begun as soon as we have basic Program CRUD.
<li>Housing - get housing type from list, then enter house name manually - no checks.
Later - auto search, full schema for housing.
Perhaps do check against house, campground names?
CRUD for those first, of course.
<li>Validations.
<li>Last, First then autofill from Mlist - foreign key.
<li>Tab order - Zip/Postal Code before City and State/Province 
and then auto fill of latter.
<li>Confirmation Notes CRUD, expanding.
<li>Confirmation Letter on first entry, later.  Use a template!
<li>Delete and Cancel a registration.
<li>Online Registration - ftp, select, import.
<li>Same Address, Copy, Move.
</ol>
<li>Generation of Web pages<br>
Use existing Perl code
modified to read directly from tables rather than dumping text files.
This can be done in parallel with Registration CRUD.
</ol>
