extra body tag okay?
    I got the focus right using it.
footer is at a particular x coord?   > 20 nrecs it stays??? :(
    it's actually off screen :(
    i tried to get rid of it entirely with no luck.
    success - edited the css file.
empty message => "There is no message".
    some way in TT to make it empty?
    failed to reset message with query parameter, too.
    tutorial says it is better to use the 'flash' technique?  what's that?
_trim in Util.pm instead of Person.pm?
not sure what is the convention for controllers /mlist/update or /person/update?
    how about for templates?   mlist/search.tt2 or person/search.tt2?
    person/update controller is in Person.pm, right?
    perhaps if the view is about a particular model then
        the tt2 file belongs there
really cool that you can muck with the view
    without restarting the server.  only when changing the controllers
    do you need to restart.
rewriting the URLs in case someone does a refresh
    good after a delete, update_do
    I followed the tutorial.
    I didn't use Catalyst.uri_for... for the form actions
        in the templates.  Okay?
check for dups in create, update
how to change the name_pref?
need to put css class/div tags in the tt2 files.
got the function - at some point the appearance
get some cute little gifs for view/edit/delete?
    steal somewhere?
maxsize for text fields? so can't scroll them.
max for nrecs?  to protect against mistakes?
i forgot affils.
need another link for crud for affils.
how to do logging??  not to browser, how into server log???
prohibit [>"'] as a_code - will interfere with html syntax
    also # ) etc.  is there a uri_encode thingy?
    to hex encode it?
tried editing root/lib/config/main
    looked like Perl so used heredoc.  no no.  this is TT.
Add to program attributes:
    registration start and end time
    program start time and end time
Add a table for _system_ type attributes:
    Start/end times for dinner on different days.
How to quote a value in the template which might
    contain a ' and a "????   e.g. last name in the
    person update form.  last name of D'Angelo.
    " is safer, I guess. but not 100%.
I notice that after the update form is submitted
    it does a selective update - only the fields that changed
    AND the blank fields are rewritten.  Yes?
I guessed (and was right) that the create method
    returns the object it just created!
isn't it rather unOO to dig into the stash hashref???
    or the params hashref???
delete_all() for deleting a person is rather inefficient
    in the way it deletes the affiliations.   better to
    just do a delete after a search on the affiliation table
    for p_id = $id!
the fancy auto generated accessor 'affils' is nice
    but it doesn't sort as I would like...
    any way to specify an order by?
need javascript validation of sex, alert before delete
    other required fields?
    date validation
    email validation
affiliations in column sort not running sort?
    since i'm not doing it in the template... i can be smarter.
    done.  nicely.  I did put some HTML in the controller.
    am I forgiven?
delete an affiliation - also delete from affil_people.
    done.
should we use automated form creation, field validation
    a la HTML::Widget as explained in part 8 of the tutorial?
    or should we do it ourselves - with better control?
    i haven't tried part 8 yet so perhaps can't speak...

partnering is next?

phone list - do I join 3 tables with descrip = "Phone List"
    or find the proper affil.id first, then join 2?
    how to do joins at all???
    or perhaps do the SQL yourself???  heavens!
