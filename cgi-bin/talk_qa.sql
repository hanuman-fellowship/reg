INSERT INTO `qa` VALUES (1,1,'What causes Arjuna to slump down in the chariot and refuse to fight?','His attachment came up. Attachment is so strong that it veils the mind and a person cannot decide what is right and what is wrong.'),(2,1,'Arjuna as a trained warrior. How does something overwhelm somebody so much?','In the battlefield, right in front of him, all their teachers were standing, as well as his friends and relatives. His mind at once said, &quot;they all will get killed.&quot; His attachment came out all at once. On the one hand, Arjuna was seeking liberation from desires, attachments and ego which are the cause of bondage, and which create a cycle of birth and death. On the other hand, he was afraid to remove them. His family members, preceptors, and his race were all projections of his desires, attachments and ego. By removal of these three great enemies, one is automatically separated from the outer world.'),(3,1,'If the Kauravas represent the negative qualities and the Pandavas represent positive qualities, does part of his despondency come from a sense of the loss of his identification with the qualities? In the battle of sadhana, are we attached to our negative qualities and reluctant to lose them because of our attachment?','We are attached to our negative qualities because they strengthen our ego. We feel our existence more in our negative aspect of life.'),(4,1,'When something pleasurable happens and we feel excitement, is it saying that we shouldn&#039;t feel the excitement or that we shouldn&#039;t be attached to the feeling of excitement?','Excitement, pleasure, happiness: they are in the mind and senses. Their reality is in attachment. Without attachment, you still feel happiness, pleasure, etc., but that doesn&#039;t create any print in the mind.'),(5,1,'It&#039;s painful in our physical body when we break that attachment or when we are separated from the things we are attached to.','Our mind-body complex are tightly together. If we hear any bad news of our loved ones, we feel like a blow on the chest. Because the ego has established a relation: &quot;my such and such.&quot; A couple newly married are very attached and feel the pain of each other. When the relationship gets bad, that feeling changes. When they separate, they don&#039;t feel anything. It proves that all those feelings are mental creations. Yes, it is very painful to break the attachment because attachment is an expression of our own egocentric existence.'),(6,1,'If one has a fatal disease, how does one deal with that, living with the knowledge and suffering that goes with that?','Attachment to life is one of the five afflictions. Its root is in egoism. When we see our body (which holds the ego within) is not completely capable to function, then the fear of losing one&#039;s existence haunts the mind. The only cure for it is to surrender to God because it is beyond human mind&#039;s capability.'),(7,1,'How to let go of attachment because desiring not to desire doesn&#039;t seem to be quite enough.','Letting go of attachments is the hardest thing because we feel their reality in every action, thought, and object. As long as the mind is not purified, ego, attachment and desire will rule our lives. How to purify the mind? By living a disciplined life, by virtuous actions and thoughts. It&#039;s a life-long practice.'),(8,1,'Is the letting go of attachment in some sense the beginning of the end of experience?','Experience is based on the knowledge of objects. If we understand the object in the wrong way, then our attachment colors the understanding that is right. That is our problem. If attachment is removed for good or bad objects, then the ego has nothing left to express its power. The mind at that point develops pure knowledge.'),(9,1,'As we go deeper in meditation, the identification and relationship to the world seems weaker as a result of the experience of meditation. There is a struggle as the mind tries to reassert its identification and relationship with the world after meditation. Is that where the anger comes from?','In meditation, one achieves peace. After meditation, the mind associates with worldly restlessness. The peaceful mind gets a shock at first but then the pull of the world colors the mind again. Anger develops when one is forcibly pulled toward the world.'),(10,1,'There is a need to recreate the relationship with the world but there is less desire to do so, so that creates anger.','Peace and restlessness: two states. They are opposite. But in relating to the world, restlessness, rajas guna, is necessary. The Gita says when the mind is well controlled, then one can relate with no attachment. There is a need to create the relationship with the world but that need creates attachment. If the needed relationship with the world is free from attachment, then there will be no anger.'),(11,1,'After some time of practicing, the mind starts seeing things more clearly and then becomes more aware of its attachments. When one realizes that the attachment is causing pain, there is a battle between the attachment and the mind that believes one needs to let go. I think that&#039;s where some of the anger comes from.','This battle doesn&#039;t end so soon. It&#039;s the ego which is our life in the world. That ego always fights with any elements which weaken it. In the Hindu Puranas there are stories of gods and anti-gods. Those are symbolic stories of this state. The ego and the anti-ego battle. In meditation, we are removing our ego of individuality and identifying with universal peace. But the ego has very strong weapons: desire and attachment. They pull the mind back to the ego.'),(12,1,'Does that mean that the ego is identifying certain thoughts in the mind as true?','The ego only supports its self-interest. Any thoughts, desires which support the ego are true but the mind can discriminate what is right and what is wrong. If the mind is overpowered by the ego, then the mind follows the ego.'),(13,1,'So we have the mind that is identifying things and the ego with its self-interest.','The intellect creates the ego. They are always together.'),(14,1,'What is the self-interest of the ego?','&quot;I may live forever.&quot; &quot;Everything should be for me.&quot;'),(15,1,'What can we use to counter the idea that &quot;I may live forever and everything should be for me?&quot; What is the real truth behind that?','Nonattachment to objects is the first step. Reflect on your attachment to objects and find out its reality. It is self-created by desires. A person goes for gambling with $5 in his pocket and wins $1000. Then slowly he loses everything. He cries for the loss of the $1000 and not for the loss of the $5. Nonattachment is developed by living a virtuous life. The ego of individuality takes the form of ego of universality by living a virtuous life.'),(1,2,'If you see another person is suffering and you do something to alleviate it, it could be done out of compassion or it could be done with a sense of feeding your ego or the other person&#039;s ego. Sometimes I get frustrated in trying to act with compassion and feel I don&#039;t know how.','Love in action is compassion. It has two forms: 1) physical expression of love, 2) love for all in one&#039;s heart. There is no end of needs and no one can get all needs fulfilled. Those who live a life of compassion, they do their best to express love in action. But you have to know that needs are unlimited. Whatever help you can give to a sufferer it should be out of love and compassion.'),(2,2,'What word is used for compassion?','Karuna.'),(3,2,'It seems that Arjuna&#039;s compassion is somewhat sentimental in Chapter 1 of the Gita. Is there an appropriate compassion in that situation?','It&#039;s natural to become sentimental in such situations when one sees all his clan people were standing in the battlefield ready to fight. Arjuna&#039;s compassion was originated out of attachment to his clan people. It&#039;s like graveyard dispassion.'),(4,2,'Wouldn&#039;t Arjuna have a compassion that was less based on attachment?','Arjuna came with a motive to fight. Fighting and compassion don&#039;t go together. Until he saw the whole Kuru clan in the battlefield, his fear of destruction of the clan created compassion.'),(5,2,'His fear seems to be coming out of compassion. Was it fear of death?','Not of his death. Destruction of Kuru clan and fear of sin which he will incur by killing his own kith and kin.'),(6,2,'Did you mean to say that you can&#039;t fight in a compassionate way?','If you are talking about external war, then the aim is to win and use all kinds of foul tactics. In the war of Mahabharata, there were set rules of war and that&#039;s why it was called dharmic war. Where there is dharma, there is compassion.'),(7,2,'What about our divine wars, when deities kill demons and free them from their karmic negativities and demonic karma, such as Rama killing the demons?','They got liberated from their demonic karmas. Those demons are within us. They get killed when a person chooses to tread on spiritual path.'),(8,2,'So that is compassion?','Its result was compassion. People put their sick dogs to sleep. The result is for the good of the dog&#039;s miseries. The action of killing is violent but out of compassion.'),(9,2,'But really it&#039;s compassion for the world because you are ridding it of the evil people.','What was the motive to fight the battle? To destroy the enemies. Krishna put the chariot in such a spot that in one glance Arjuna could see the whole Kuru clan. It was a shock to him. But Krishna advocated that fighting with these evil enemies is a war of dharma, it is the duty. Yes, it was a divine compassion to remove evilness from the mind of human beings.'),(10,2,'How do we see the inner battle in terms of compassion and anger?','How would you deal with your negative action? You go through a hard austerity in order to remove your anger. When anger is removed, compassion takes its place.'),(11,2,'By getting angry or depressed.','We cannot win the inner battle by being angry. It is won by living a disciplined spiritual life.'),(12,2,'Don&#039;t we need compassion for ourselves even to see the truth of ourselves?','We need compassion but compassion is neither only self-pity nor is it only words. It purifies the mind and that purified mind perceives the Truth.'),(13,2,'Isn&#039;t it better to oppose the negative with compassion rather than with violence?','It depends on situation. In some situations, violence is used and in certain situations compassion is used.'),(14,2,'Can you oppose something without violence?','&quot;Oppose&quot; is violence, but we can oppose some thing without using negativity in our actions, thoughts and feelings.'),(15,2,'Ahimsa is such a high value.','Ahimsa means not to harm anyone including yourself. You are harming yourself by your negativities. So it is not ahimsa. Ahimsa is the base of all 10 rules of restraints and observances of Ashtanga Yoga. But it is not easy to understand Ahimsa. A lion kills a deer. For us it is violence but for a lion, deer is his food. Nature created that relationship of consumer (lion)  deer (food).'),(16,2,'If I have a bad habit and I want to get rid of it, I can get depressed, I can get angry, or I can deny that I have it.','If you really want to get rid of the bad habit, then you have to fight with all those elements which support that bad habit.'),(17,2,'What really works for me is when I realize it and then the action just stops with no effort.','Yes. When one understands that the bad habit is damaging one&#039;s life and that bad habit is his/her own creation, then the person automatically removes that habit.'),(18,2,'Anger gets Arjuna to the battle before he sees his attachments. Then he begins to have compassion; then he realizes that tapas is the only way out. Is that what the whole Gita is teaching?','Yes. That&#039;s the way Gita started, but Lord Krishna gives the whole philosophy of Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga to remove the delusion from the mind.'),(19,2,'In our inner battle, is there the same pattern?','Yes. Gita uses Mahabharata battle symbolically to explain the inner battle.'),(20,2,'In this case, it&#039;s really attachment and not compassion?','It is attachment which deluded Arjuna and blocked his path of liberation. Krishna out of compassion removed those blocks by his teachings.'),(21,2,'So it&#039;s showing a big trap right at the beginning of sadhana?','Yes. Arjuna grew up in a Vedic culture. He was not illiterate. He knew dharma and adharma but attachment (moha) is a very powerful energy. Even the wise can get deluded by it.'),(22,2,'Wasn&#039;t Krishna&#039;s action actually compassion in opposition to Arjuna&#039;s ignorance? We have to fight against the things that are harming us. That&#039;s a compassionate act but it&#039;s also painful.','Out of love Krishna yelled at Arjuna to remove his deluded ideas. It was out of compassion.'),(23,2,'It&#039;s not the act but what is behind the act. When we do tapas, we are knocking on our own heads.','Yes. Motive behind any action brings its result accordingly.'),(24,2,'So it&#039;s out of love for the higher Self so it&#039;s compassionate even though it seems violent?','It is a compassionate act on the part of Lord Krishna to pull out Arjuna from the mire of delusion by force. Even though it was mixed with violence.'),(25,2,'So we are supposed to beat ourselves up compassionately? The real thing is the same to seek liberation not for selfish gain.','To achieve that aim, what do we do? We are fighting with our inner demons. To be honest to ourselves is compassion to ourselves.'),(26,2,'Tapah, Swadhyaya, Ishwara Pranidhana. Those three make more sense in that context.','It&#039;s a method called Kriya Yoga in Patanjali Yoga Sutras.'),(27,2,'I never understood why those were selected as one method.','Those three cover all the eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga. Those who are more sharp-minded people, they can grasp the essence of Kriya Yoga and for others, Ashtanga Yoga is the method.'),(28,2,'Actually you could divide it as Krishna on one side and all the others on the other side?','If we say that way, then no Gita. We have to see the individual life in positive and negative sides. Krishna, the higher Self, was on both sides and also separate from both sides.'),(29,2,'But in reality Krishna is not involved in the war?','Krishna was not fighting in the war but his army was on Kaurava&#039;s side and he himself chose not to fight but worked as Arjuna&#039;s charioteer.'),(30,2,'Why does Krishna have to break down Arjuna&#039;s habit pattern of being a warrior before he can rebuild him?','Krishna knew his weakness. He brought his weakness to the surface so he could see it. Arjuna is the jiva (embodied soul) trying to get liberated. In getting liberation, first we have to know what we want to get liberated from.'),(31,2,'So Arjuna&#039;s compassionate nature was okay but in this case it was interfering with his duty?','He was compassionate but at the wrong time and in a wrong situation. Such compassion indicates his weakness.'),(32,2,'So for Arjuna going to battle was a tapas?','It is called yajna. It is sacrifice. Sacrifice is tapas.'),(33,2,'Is this story showing that if you look at negative things through a colored lens, then grace might be on the other side?','Both negative and positive are mental perception. The ego is the perceiver which colors everything with a color of selfish interest. Grace is always there for everyone but those who make themselves fit to have it by purifying their mind, they achieve it. Others miss it.'),(1,3,'The time of death can be a pretty intense time. If I understand correctly, if you would be able to merge with God in samadhi, you would also be able to merge with God at the time of death.','At the time of death, the five elements of the body start changing very fast. Each element has a color and is associated with a guna. So it&#039;s a very confused state of mind in the average person. But for those who practice meditation or tread in the path of devotion, the thought of God makes a deep groove in the mind. No matter how much the mind gets confused, the thought of God still exists. Such devoted people in the next birth carry the same devotional state.'),(2,3,'Regarding the time of death, some older people really seem to welcome death. So is there some point before death at which the attachment reappears.','Yes. Only those who renounce the world completely in their heart, they don&#039;t get fear. We do get dispassion by the miseries of life, but when the mind looks to the attachment to the world, it still wants it. So really dispassion starts by God consciousness and not by the miseries in life. Miseries in life push a person to seek for God.'),(3,3,'So their desire is freedom from pain and death is seen as a way out of pain?','Yes.'),(4,3,'In the example of the woman who lost her mind before she died, it doesn&#039;t seem like she would have a thought at the time of death. So is there a different point at which she died, in the sense of losing her mental connection with the world?','As long as there was an awareness of the world, she was living. When that awareness was gone, only the body was living.'),(5,3,'So at the time she lost awareness of the world, was that the time the samskara was encapsulated?','Yes. After that point, she was not creating any samskaras either.'),(6,3,'When my sister died, it seems she would be in pain and agitated and then alternately calm and peaceful. She was comatose.','In a state of coma, the mind doesn&#039;t relate to the outer world. What goes on inside the person is not known.'),(7,3,'So would it matter if she actually died when the mind was agitated or peaceful?','Dying in peace is better because the mind which identifies that peace will create samskaras of peace and in the next birth, the person will achieve more peace.'),(8,3,'Is it hard to focus on Om while you are dying?','In theory it is not hard. But when death approaches, so many thoughts appear and confuse the mind that the person forgets about God. So the mind is prepared by keeping continuous remembrance of God. Om is the word which indicates God. That is why yogis practice japa or repetition of Om continuously all the time.'),(9,3,'Would it help if people practiced Omkar (chanting of Om) while a person is dying?','Yes, the sound energy will purify. Also the group mind will become one which creates a positive affect on the dying person.'),(10,3,'I was working with a man who was dying. He told me that he was scared and began talking about his life, reviewing all that had happened. When he finished he was ready to accept that his life was coming to an end. Is this a method we could use to review our own past in order to free ourselves from it?','Yes. We have created that fear of death by our own ignorance. We never think about our own death. We dream about the earthquake. Everyone dies. But we never dream that I am among the dead. Somehow, I am alive. Because to live forever is a strong desire within us. We don&#039;t want to die, so we don&#039;t think about it. By thinking about one&#039;s own death, the fear starts getting weaker.'),(11,3,'Is developing dispassion and creating a conscious attitude toward physical death really the same thing?','Yes. But the mind can always trick. It can be dispassionate for some time and still there is a subtle desire to live. If we accept the truth as truth, then there is no fear. Accepting the truth is frightening. We always push behind the mortality of life and always think &#039;I may live forever.&#039; It creates deep attachment to the world.'),(12,3,'Is there a way to release the feelings of loss in one&#039;s life when someone dies or leaves your day-to-day reality?','We are attached to this worldly reality so tightly that we forget that everything will die away some day. We cling to its immortality. But when the object is removed, we see the empty space and cry for the object to fill that vacuum. We cling to something which is unreal. But that unreality is very real to us, like a mirage in the desert.'),(13,3,'How do we learn to live with that empty space?','By understanding that it always was an empty space and our attachment falsely created an object in it. You have a car. Your attachment creates immortality in that car. If the car gets a dent, you get upset. You don&#039;t get upset if someone else&#039;s car is totally destroyed.'),(1,4,'People who have near-death experiences come back with feelings of bliss rather than fear. How can the near-death experience help us in our progress on the spiritual path?','At the time of death, the elements in the body start changing very quickly. The mind gets confused and the person feels fear. Then the elements stop and the mind gets fixed. If it&#039;s fixed in a positive state, then bliss is experienced. In some it doesn&#039;t (get fixed in the bliss). When they come back they talk about their fearful experiences. In some, insight dawns because the mind is fixed in a positive state and that memory exists in coming back. One soldier in war when a bomb dropped his whole company was killed and he lived half buried in the trench. When he was dug out and came back to his senses, he was a different person. He developed firm belief on God and finally became a renunciate.'),(2,4,'What determines whether a person will experience a bliss state or not at the time of death?','The karmas. Life from birth to death is guided by karma samskara. If a person lives a virtuous life, then virtuous samskaras will guide the person&#039;s life.'),(3,4,'At the time of death when the elements are changing rapidly and there is confusion and fear, what is the method to fix the mind in positivity?','It depends on regular practice. It can&#039;t be done without prior practice of concentration. At the time of death, people lose control over the mind. Only a few keep awareness of God at that moment.'),(4,4,'If there is prior practice, is there a specific method for that time?','Concentration on your inner Self in a form of light.'),(5,4,'For a loved one&#039;s peace, how important is it to be quiet with a loved one as they are dying?','We are quiet with people we know. We are related or deeply attached. At the time of death, there is fear. The dying person needs a support even though we can&#039;t save the person. &quot;I am here for you.&quot; It&#039;s a big support. &quot;Quiet&quot; in that situation means not to create any negative feelings.'),(6,4,'My mother is elderly and I travel a lot. There&#039;s a good chance that I won&#039;t be there for her when she dies. I worry about it.','What is destined can&#039;t be changed. When my mother was dying, she was far away and I did not see her for years. Somehow unknowingly, I reached there when she was dying. She said, &quot;I was waiting for you&quot; and died. So this mechanism is unknown. Your worry will not change the destiny.'),(7,4,'When I say the healing mantra at the bedside of someone who is dying, is that helping the person who is dying or is it simply helping me? Or both?','1) It is helping you keep the mind in a positive state. 2) It is helping the dying person because your positive state of mind is reaching out to the person.'),(8,4,'My father died several years ago. He had a lot of negativity in his life. I am saying prayers for him now. Will that help him at all in his future birth?','It will help you, that I can tell. If it will help him in his future birth can&#039;t be proved. But we believe it does.'),(9,4,'I was interested in the story of the soldier who changed into a different person. I have spiritual awakenings on a regular basis but then go back to sleep. Can the transformation happen in an instant?','What was changed in him? He got retirement and renounced the world and became a hermit. You have spiritual awakening on a regular basis but nothing changes. Spiritual awakening means &quot;change&quot;: change towards a virtuous life. Spiritual enlightenment is not time bound. It can happen to anyone at any time.'),(10,4,'Can you experience fear of death during sadhana or meditation? If so, what do you do?','Yes, it happens. Why it happens? We are attached to our egocentric existence. In sadhana, the ego starts fading away and we don&#039;t know &quot;who am I now.&quot; This fear of death disappears when one develops knowledge of one&#039;s real Self.'),(11,4,'When I was faced with a life-threatening situation, I felt a fear of death and then it changed into attachment to life. Is that a disguised form of fear of death?','Both mean the same. Abhinivesha Klesha. It is one of the five afflictions in life: 1) ignorance, 2) egoism, 3) attachment, 4) aversion, 5) fear of death or attachment to life.'),(12,4,'Could there come a point at which there is no value to prolonging one&#039;s life?','When living becomes more painful than the pain of dying, then we cry out &quot;I would rather be dead.&quot; So we accept it in one level. We want to live if the quality of life is good. But on the other hand, the attachment to life doesn&#039;t leave us. I saw a leper in India: no hands, no feet, no nose; all rotted away. I asked her if she wanted to die. She said, &quot;No, I can still move around.&quot;'),(13,4,'Ramana Maharshi and other realized beings suffered so much pain in their life. If God loves these realized beings so much, why do they have to suffer so much?','Samskaras of this body are worked out by going through physical sufferings. Ramana Maharshi lived in very bad conditions which affected his body. The question is how it affected his mind. Only one who did not relate oneself with body-mind complex can tell. I knew a saint from Kausani, &quot;Brahmachari of Kausani.&quot; He was from a kingly family and renounced everything. In his youth, he was worshipped as a siddha. In his old age, he had abdominal cancer. Two of his disciples were taking care of him. Brahmachari would cry out of pain. The two disciples would say, &quot;he is above all pain,&quot; and ignore his cry. How did he feel? Body samskaras are worked out when the body dies.'),(14,4,'Is it necessary to go through intense physical suffering, like self-torture, in order to detach from our bodies?','A wild horse gets punished in training. After the horse is trained, only words are enough to guide the horse. Ignorant mind needs torturous austerity until one understands the truth of life.'),(15,4,'Or does somebody have to get cancer or something in order to realize they don&#039;t want to be in this body and detach from it?','Pain in life, whether it is physical, emotional or devotional, develops dispassion for the world. It is not necessary to get some serious illness in order to achieve dispassion. Intense devotion to God is also painful but it brings dispassion.'),(16,4,'In order to detach from the body, do we have to go through the pain of the body or can we just learn to detach through our mind?','Those who are intelligent understand the way to remove themselves by self-reflection. Those who are not so intelligent go through hard austerities.'),(17,4,'What about an individual who feels so much deep pain, or they hate themselves so much, that they inflict pain upon others?','Yes, that can happen because they don&#039;t accept the law of nature. When living becomes harder than to die, then people do such things to die. They inflict pain upon others in various ways.'),(18,4,'How can we accept that pain?','It&#039;s very hard to accept pain or to make someone else accept pain because we cling to life and we don&#039;t want to lose our existence. But it&#039;s our duty to express compassion and love to sufferers.'),(1,5,'Will you talk about how to endure the impulse of desire and anger?','Desire and anger disturb the natural state of the mind. To keep the mind stable in desire and anger, that is enduring. Samvedhana - contact with an object; bhavana - the object was in the past, now only its thought is coming; vasana - the thought of the object is creating a desire to obtain it; kalana - the deep imprint of the desire exists in the mind causing pain. Mind originally is pure. When it contacts an object, then it starts thinking to have it. That way desire develops and brings pain.'),(2,5,'About the impulse, is that the deep desire?','Kalana or samskaras of desires which we carry since birth. It&#039;s like waves. Rising and subsiding all the time.'),(3,5,'We talked about removing the object of desire from thought. The first thing to do is to remove the thought of the object that the mind desires. It seems that first there is an impulse, the general waves or the wanting to desire, the tendency to desire that is in us.','Bhavana. The thought of an object is a memory of experience we had gained in the past. One who had never tasted meat dish will have no thought of it because there is no memory of experience.'),(4,5,'Then there is a specific, the particle part of it ...','That is vasana, or desire that is always there.'),(5,5,'When I try to remove the thought from my mind, sometimes I can catch it and put it outside, but sometimes it gets in through the back door somehow and it becomes more than just a mental thing and I cannot take it and collect it into a particle any more and put it outside the mind. It&#039;s too big. It&#039;s hard to remove the thought when the mind is attached to the desired object. As long as attachment exists, the mind will create different ways to set it. The Gita commentary said, &quot;In a state of fear, desire and anger are not seen in a person.&quot; Could you talk more about fear and how it relates to desire, anger and attachment?','Desire =&gt; anger =&gt; violence and fear. When the desire for an object is obstructed, it gives rise to anger. Where there is anger, there is fear also. Anger is a defense mechanism to defend the frightened ego.'),(6,5,'In verse 23, Krishna says &quot;one who is able to endure while still here in this world, before casting off this body, before casting off the impulse of desire and anger is a yogi, is a happy man.&quot; Would you comment?','When ego, attachment and desires don&#039;t rule a person&#039;s life. Human beings know happiness only when desires are fulfilled and experience anger when desires are obstructed. So it is very hard to imagine happiness without any desire and anger. In verse 24, Krishna says &quot;happiness within.&quot; It means the Self-experienced in its real nature: Sat-chit-ananda.'),(7,5,'What are examples of subtle desire and anger?','Desire and anger can appear in various levels. The more one advances in spiritual life, the more the desires get subtle. They are not known to others, but the practitioner can see them. A high yogi can be attached to possessions, but outwardly it is not seen as attachment. Desire for power, fame, etc. can be very subtle.'),(8,5,'We try to be mindful of our speech and actions to reduce negative karma, yet it is often through the hurtful actions of others that we learn our greatest lessons and really develop compassion. Why then does the person who was the greatest teacher attract negative karma to themselves for that action?','Someone harms us and we learn from it. The reason is the senses always contact the outer world. They can&#039;t contact our own mental state. The mind gets involved deeply with the senses and it understands the harm that is experienced outwardly. So from our childhood to the death of the body, first knowledge is achieved from the outer world. In the case of spiritual people who are engaged in self-development, they learn differently. They reflect on their own ego, attachment and desires, and think that the outer world is only a reflection of their inner emotion. In high beings, the effect of negative karma is seen, like Mahatma Gandhi, who preached non-violence, was shot and killed. It is a war between positive and negative forces. Sometimes negative force gets too strong.'),(9,5,'Would you please explain more about what you mean by the Self as the friend of all beings?','In friends there are things that are common and acceptable to each other. A Self-realized person sees the same Self in others, and becomes a friend of all.'),(10,5,'I went to a camp last week with other young people my age and there was talking and dancing, etc. I was interested in talking and relating with them, and increasing my social circle, and at the same time, I was reading one of your books so there was a kind of duality. How do I maintain relations with people and friends who are dealing with mundane things and still remain thinking about God?','We have two lives: internal, which is only for ourselves and external, which is social. We live in both. If we don&#039;t unite them, then there is no problem. You have your spiritual life, but you do many other things. There is no conflict if you do other things that are supportive of your spiritual life. If you do something like hunting, it is not supportive and there is conflict. When you play, talk, sing, with your friends, if it is not harming your spiritual life, you are not separate from God.'),(11,5,'When someone comes to live in an ashram and they want to control their desires, the ashram supports that desire to reduce desires. In the tribal situation, one is forced to control them against one&#039;s will.','Common people walk on the footsteps of elder people. In a spiritual community, if the elders are honestly trying to remove their negative qualities, then the new people who come in the community follow them. In a tribe, there is one leader who controls and sets his/her own rules. Those rules may not be acceptable to some tribal members but they have to accept them out of fear.'),(1,6,'I am curious about the relationship between desire and attachment. It seems that desire without attachment doesn&#039;t make sense because there is no attachment without desire. Why do we say ego, attachment and desire go together?','Desire and attachments are expressions of ego. Desire without attachment doesn&#039;t create reality of anything desired. Without the ego there are no desire and attachment. So ego, attachment and desires are together.'),(2,6,'If we just worked on our attachments, wouldn&#039;t that work?','Yes, the first step is to develop nonattachment to objects. It will weaken the desires. When attachment and desires are weakened, the ego will lose its control over the mind. Ego is the root cause. But we need steps to lead up to the ego.'),(3,6,'Isn&#039;t the attachment that we feel to our body more than just the ego? Could it be a physiological function of the nervous system?','Whose nervous system? The experiencer? The ego is soaked in every atom of the body. The body elements are together because they are united by the ego.'),(4,6,'Ultimately, it&#039;s all in the mind, right?','Yes, because the ego is rooted in the mind. The ego cannot function without the mind. So it is right to say &quot;it&#039;s all in the mind.&quot;'),(5,6,'You&#039;ve said desire without attachment is no fun. Could you give an example of a desire with no attachment?','A person is craving for ice cream. Ice cream is in his hand and in his mind. Another person gets ice cream because he is thirsty. Ice cream could be replaced by water. Because ice cream was available, he takes it. He goes with no memory of ice cream. The other person leaves with a memory of ice cream because his attachment to the taste created a deep impression on his mind.'),(6,6,'So the second person was desiring ice cream but not attached to it?','(Nods yes.) In World War II, everything was rationed. What was given, people would take. There was no question of desire or craving. So there was no memory of it.'),(7,6,'Why do you call it desiring ice cream when there is no attachment to it? He didn&#039;t really desire ice cream. He was only thirsty.','It&#039;s a desire in word, but without attachment, desire has no life.'),(8,6,'If desire without attachment is no fun, and we are trying to eliminate attachment, how are we to have more?','&quot;To have more&quot; is based on desire and without attachment, desire &quot;to have more&quot; will not exist. For those who are seeking for liberation, they don&#039;t desire to have more. They remain contented on what they get.'),(9,6,'What about attachment to another human being?','We are seeking to be less attached but still we are in these relationships. If you are less attached, will you care less or not? If you are more attached, how do you express it differently? Attachment is a feeling in the heart generated by the ego of ownership. It has nothing to do with your outer activities. You still love your mate, children, friends, but you never forget their mortality. You are not attached ignorantly.'),(10,6,'So is our attachment to others really an attachment to our self-interest projected onto others?','Ego expresses its existence by desire and attachment and the ego always seeks for its self-interest.'),(11,6,'What is the value and responsibility of the family relations? Should we relate to our family members just as any other person or should we hold them in special regard?','You are attached to your family and feel a sense of duty. If you deeply reflect on attachment, you will understand the attachment and duties in the world are separate. We express our attachment in a state of ignorance. We think &quot;the family cannot exist without me.&quot; This selfish tie doesn&#039;t exist if attachment is understood. But the actions and duties will remain the same.'),(12,6,'What about attachment to our family members and people whom we love?','We create our own realities. That reality is &quot;I may live forever and all those who are dear to me will be with me all the time.&quot; It appears very real and we cover the truth which is neither will &quot;I live forever&quot; nor &quot;will those dear to me remain with me forever.&quot; When this truth is understood, the person still functions as before but doesn&#039;t feel the same feelings of attachment as before. A child is attached to the toy. The toy for an adult has not the same meaning, but the parent still keeps the toy for the child. When we understand the truth, we don&#039;t stop our duties in the world.'),(13,6,'What are the ways to undo attachments that are deep-seated in the mind?','By understanding the nature of the ego. The ego exists and expresses itself by desire and attachment. Desire and attachment are real for ignorants and they are unreal for the wise. Both ignorant and wise do their duties in the world in the same way, but their inner feelings are different.'),(14,6,'Could you talk about ways to cultivate nonattachment or dispassion?','Dispassion has no method to cultivate. It develops when knowledge develops. What is that knowledge that develops dispassion? It is the knowledge of understanding the non-reality of the world.'),(1,7,'Is there one thing you can say that is most important about spiritual life?','Achieve eternal peace.'),(2,7,'What does it mean to live a virtuous life? It seems there are so many different religions today.','Do you know what a non-virtuous life is? Non-virtuous actions are known easily because their affect appears fast. Truthfulness, non-violence, non-jealousy, and non-anger: all those things are in a virtuous life. All religions preach about universal virtuous actions.'),(3,7,'In performing actions, sometimes our not so good qualities come out. Is it beneficial to sometimes take a break from action to reflect on oneself or do we transform ourselves only through performing action?','In worldly life and spiritual life, the quality of action is not the same. In worldly life we have to work with some self-interest. So to achieve our self-interest, anger, fear and all kinds of emotions arise. But if we have chosen to live a spiritual life, then in every moment of our life we have to watch our ego.'),(4,7,'Self-interest and expectation for result always creeps in when trying to run a business and make it succeed. How can I reduce self-interest in my life?','It&#039;s difficult for everyone as long as the spirit of selfless service is not understood. You buy a car. You take care of the car. You own the car; it is all right. But when there is a feeling inside you about the possession of the car, then it becomes the cause of pain. When we talk about selfless service, we think we don&#039;t have to think that there is success or failure. We don&#039;t have to plan. We don&#039;t have to think of what to do. We do everything which needs to be done but that possessive feeling that creates pain, we don&#039;t let it develop.'),(5,7,'When the feeling of possession is seen, what is the next step to do?','Feeling of possessiveness is experienced as soon as we achieve something thinking, &quot;I own it.&quot; It&#039;s weakened by developing nonattachment. How to develop nonattachment? By living a virtuous life.'),(6,7,'What if one is not aware of the meaning of offering or prayer, but goes about fulfilling their duty of working and caring for a family?','If a person is living a virtuous life, then automatically all actions are offered to God. Four aims of human life, dharma, artha, kama, moksha. Dharma means virtuous life. Artha means to achieve wealth. Kama is fulfilling of desires. Moksha is achieving liberation. Dharma is listed first so dharma is in artha and kama. The result of it is liberation.'),(7,7,'So an animal only has dharma, can only act out of its own nature?','Dharma term has several meanings. Duty, religion, virtuous life, nature born quality. Animals are born to fulfill their duty (dharma) to exist in the world. Their existence is part of nature.'),(8,7,'Artha could also be translated as meaning or purpose?','Artha also means purposefulness.'),(9,7,'How would satisfying desire fit in with leading a virtuous life?','Desires (kama) which are based on dharma (virtues) will support our spiritual life in the world. It is not the desire to reinforce worldliness in the mind, like desire to gamble.'),(10,7,'So that means satisfying basic needs?','Kama based on dharma is not lustful desire. It&#039;s the desire to sustain life, to sustain the family, and to sustain the society.'),(11,7,'Is it saying that we have to do our duty according to our place in life and we have to do selfless service?','Yes. A child, a grown-up, the old person can&#039;t have the same duty. But according to their own stage of life, they can do selfless service.'),(12,7,'What is the duty of a child?','Duty of a child is to learn and to use what is learned for the good of society.'),(13,7,'It seems that all human beings have their own dharma and everyone should chip in to the society to keep it going. If one person doesn&#039;t chip in, does that make it necessary for others to make up for that person?','Every living being has a dharma. Human beings have individual dharma as well as universal dharma. All human beings share universal dharma. Some people are anti-dharma. Because of their anti-dharma nature, they can create problems for others. But their opposition doesn&#039;t live for long.'),(14,7,'Those who are advanced in understanding, such as the great leaders of mankind, they seem to be doing the work that others neglected.','There are always reformists to remove old corrupt practices in a culture. Also there is opposition to the reform which gives rise to violence.'),(15,7,'Is dharma something we pursue or do we just let come into our life?','The term dharma has several meanings. It means religion, duty, or a nature born quality without which a thing can&#039;t exist. If we see it in a broader sense, dharma means duty. The duty of a human being is to experience the world and get liberation. In the Gita that duty is explained as &quot;service to others,&quot; Karma Yoga. It develops by itself when our egocentric desires are reduced.'),(16,7,'When adharma is sharply on the increase, God sends an enlightened one to guide humans. When things aren&#039;t quite that bad, it&#039;s said many sattvic people are incarnated to help out. Is that a valid way of understanding?','Yes, a reformist with divine qualities appears to reestablish dharma again. There is an opposite to that also. When Prahlada, the demon king, got absorbed in samadhi, there was no one to rule over the demons and they stopped their demonic actions. Thus the devas got lazy because there was no one to torture them so the lord went to Prahlada and pulled him back to work. If there would be no pain and miseries in life, then no one would try to attain peace. So those people with demonic nature are also important to strengthen dharma in the world.'),(17,7,'Could the destruction of all living beings be looked upon as meaning the destruction of ignorance, or the destruction of darkness, and thus the enlightenment of all beings?','When the action is stopped, enlightenment is not possible. Enlightenment is achieved by living a virtuous life. Virtuous life is learned by following dharma. Ignorance is the cause of adharma. Wisdom removes ignorance.'),(18,7,'It says Krishna has attained liberation and has no obligations toward the world. Then it says that if he doesn&#039;t do anything, then he is responsible for the destruction of all beings.','Who is Krishna? Krishna in the Gita represents the conscious principle. If we take Krishna as an historical figure who was completely enlightened and nonattached, still he had the duty to maintain the world order. So he presented his life as a model of virtuous life for people to follow. If a person has no discipline in life and no one to follow as a spiritual model, that person will start doing things that affect the society negatively. What Krishna is saying is that people should lead a dharmic life.'),(19,7,'At what point do we stop sheltering people from their ignorance? It says the wise people teach by example. When does a person begin teaching in words?','The Gita is not rejecting intellectual teachings. It&#039;s saying that personally performing action is a better teaching than saying.'),(20,7,'So teaching by explaining is acceptable if someone asks?','A man had a son. He was addicted to sweets. He took his son to a sadhu for telling the son to stop eating sweets. The sadhu said, &quot;come after a month and then I will tell your son.&quot; The sadhu himself was addicted to sweets so he stopped eating sweets. So after a month when the man returned with his son, the sadhu told him why he didn&#039;t tell him to stop eating sweets the first time. So words alone do not work if there is no truthful energy behind it. You can explain great philosophies but if you don&#039;t follow the philosophy, then it will remain just words.'),(21,7,'Do &quot;the wise teach by example&quot; because ultimate reality is something that can&#039;t be explained?','Yes. You cannot explain the sweetness of an apple. You can say it&#039;s like sugar but different. The person will know the taste of an apple only by eating. By being with saints and wise people, a person learns by watching them.'),(1,8,'Babaji, could you please define dispassion?','It means &quot;without passion.&quot; But the term dispassion in yogic language is more subtle. We translate it as dispassion, but the term is vairagya. Rag is the attachment which connects us to every object. Vi = without. So dispassion means &quot;without that attachment that connects us to every object.&quot; You have a child and you love your child. It&#039;s natural. In a state of vairagya, your love doesn&#039;t change. Your duty doesn&#039;t change. But the mind understands that your connection is only an idea. How we create an idea which appears very real? In marriage, what makes two people wife and husband? When they divorce, what breaks? That idea. So it&#039;s only mental conditioning and de-conditioning.'),(2,8,'Why was Arjuna&#039;s desire to know God not directly seeking for God?','Because it was out of fear that he wanted to know God. In reality, God is known by dispassion for the world. His attachment to his family and friends possessed his mind and he was afraid that they all will get killed. So he wanted to renounce the world and live like a recluse.'),(3,8,'Is it true that the only way to know God is through dispassion and not through fear?','There are four conditions out of which a person seeks for God. 1) Arta or out of pain which includes fear. 2) Artharti or desire for worldly prosperity. 3) Jigyansu or out of desire to know God. 4) Jnani or one who has knowledge of God principle. Dispassion is in all four conditions in degrees.'),(4,8,'Can a person feel dispassion and compassion simultaneously?','Compassion is our nature. It is blocked by the ego and develops when the mind is pure. The mind is purified by dispassion. Compassion means deep sympathy for the sufferer. Because we have experience of sufferings and we understand the sufferings of others, so we develop compassion. But it is still a lower type of compassion. The highest compassion is with dispassion. We are not attached to the act of compassion. It automatically happens.'),(5,8,'How can one develop dispassion or a disinclination to be attracted to the world?','How do you get attached to the world? When our senses enjoy the world, they create an illusory reality of the world and, hence, get attached to it. By understanding that in the absence of sensual pleasures, there is pain, we remove ourselves from that momentary pleasure. That is dispassion.'),(6,8,'In Patanjali&#039;s Yoga Sutras it says that in order to achieve dispassion we have to shun desire for experience. What is a good way to approach this? Should we take the attitude of &quot;it is my duty&quot;?','One can also find fault in the object of desire in order to weaken the desire for the world. Think how it ends up causing pain. For example, wealth: it is an attachment. It creates fear of losing, being stolen. But you can still deal with it without attachment, like a bank manager deals with money as his duty and doesn&#039;t develop attachment to it. In the same way, when the mind is not attached to worldly activities, but still must be engaged in activities, it will not harm. Nonattachment creates dispassion.'),(7,8,'Is vairagya (dispassion) created by understanding or by practicing austerity?','1) Knowledge of reality is viveka. 2) Detachment from unreal is vairagya. When you attain knowledge of reality, you become detached from the unreal. They both develop simultaneously. But when we say develop vairagya, or detachment, we mean developing good qualities which will remove bad qualities. Austerities are practiced to weaken desires for the world. When the desire for the world is weakened the mind automatically becomes dispassionate.'),(8,8,'I&#039;m wondering whether it is appropriate for Westerners to focus on death and dying as a method of learning dispassion toward the body.','Death creates dispassion in any person in any country. It&#039;s a reality of life which is seen. We struggle for our whole lives for possessions, for pleasure, and for self-gratification. And then what do we see? A person is dead.'),(1,9,'Is it God that judges us or do we judge ourselves for our actions?','God doesn&#039;t judge anything. Our mind is made for judging, discriminating, understanding. It is our ego which uses the mind to judge others and ourselves.'),(2,9,'Do our actions follow us into our next life?','Actions motivated by the ego create samskaras. Those samskaras get active in the next life.'),(3,9,'If it is the ego which judges each individual action from a selfish perspective, should we then search within ourselves for forgiveness?','Yes, but human mind always projects out. We look for some reason somewhere else. We don&#039;t go within to look for that reality. We can forgive ourselves only when we realize the Truth.'),(4,9,'Doesn&#039;t the eternal reality actually also exist within us?','Yes, when the ego is projecting out, then it&#039;s our own mental creation. If the ego is removed, then there is no in or out. That is eternal reality.'),(5,9,'How does mantra affect the ego?','If the mind is engaged in the God principle, through the mantra, then the ego will not go towards worldly things.'),(6,9,'In relation to humiliation, it seems you couldn&#039;t feel humiliated unless one was defending the ego.','Yes. It is the ego which feels humiliated and fights back, takes revenge or separates itself.'),(7,9,'It seems like this is a series of battles with the ego. It seems the ego gets smarter and more subtle.','Right! The ego starts learning about the cause of its own pain and finds ways to get out from all worldly miseries.'),(8,9,'Is there any end to this?','Ego can take any form for its own existence. It can get so subtle that we can&#039;t see it or feel it. Then it starts affecting the mind in a grosser level. There is an end when the individual ego starts accepting universality by selfless service, Karma Yoga.'),(9,9,'Could you give an illustration of how the ego can be so subtle that we can&#039;t see it or feel it and then it comes to a grosser level?','A monk used to heal people. One time a woman who had tuberculosis came to live nearby. He gave her a hut to live close by. He healed her. Then his desire to have a woman started developing. There was a subtle desire all along but it was dormant. The desire got active when the woman was there. Desire is an expression of the ego.'),(10,9,'In a group of people where death is eminent, some people will fight to survive and other people may just give up because they don&#039;t feel they can go on. Could you comment on the difference between people who respond in such different ways?','All will fight. Some are stronger and will fight to the last. Some are weaker and will give up.'),(11,9,'Where does the ego come in there?','Ego is the fighter. It fights until it loses the battle.'),(12,9,'So that&#039;s not surrender to God?','The loser surrenders. When the ego realizes, &#039;I am no more in control,&#039; then it has no choice but to surrender.'),(13,9,'Could you talk about the ego of individuality in a state of meditation as opposed to working in its field of activity where the fear arises?','When the mind concentrates deeply on any spiritual object, the ego (whose nature is to go out in the world) stops. The ego in that state is separated from everything and dwells in its own universal form. It experiences its own pure conscious nature. But when vyutthana samskaras (outgoing thoughts) arise, the concentration is pulled down and the ego starts experiencing its individuality again.'),(14,9,'What created fear in Arjuna?','Ego comes back with desires and attachment. Fear develops due to attachment. We are afraid of losing attachment. Ego of individuality is strengthened by desire and attachment.'),(15,9,'Is there any other surrender except blind surrender?','Blind surrender is out of fear. Real surrender comes when one starts knowing the greatness of God.'),(1,10,'How do we understand Krishna&#039;s comment that a person of knowledge is more dear to him?','God is unconditional, all-pervasive, eternal love. A person of knowledge loves God, so God&#039;s presence is always in that person&#039;s heart which is divine love. That divine love is projecting out through the person. If we say that God chooses to love the wise person, then it means that God discriminates. If God is all-pervasive, then God has no reason to choose.'),(2,10,'So even if we use an impersonal concept of God like love, is that still within the realm of the mind?','Love is expressed and felt through the mechanics of mind.'),(3,10,'It seems that the Bhagavad Gita is about war in conjunction with the spiritual teachings. What about the concept of love? Is that there anywhere?','Love is a state of mind not polluted by selfish desires. If love is conditional, then it is selfishness. Pure love is like a light which spreads out equally for everyone. Love cannot develop as long as inner demons are not killed. This is the war in the Gita.'),(4,10,'The battle is also a metaphor for an internal struggle that goes on between our positive and negative qualities. It&#039;s a symbolic story that brings that out in an understandable and exciting form.','In each person, there is a pure consciousness which we refer to as divine consciousness. There is also an ego consciousness which is not pure because it works with our self interest only. So God is dwelling in everyone in two forms. If we use the ego consciousness for the good of others, then we progress. If we use it only for worldly achievements, then we get trapped. We are born with a conditioning and that conditioning is &quot;I am this mind-body complex.&quot; The ego expresses this conditioning and creates its own bondage. We are also born with faith and devotion. That is also conditioning of the mind. But the spiritual conditioning deconditions worldly conditioning.'),(5,10,'So the struggle is between two forces and that is the war.','Yes.'),(6,10,'In history, saints are spoken of as compassion and infinite love. You speak of dispassion.','Compassion is unconditional love. Without dispassion, everything is conditioned by the mind and ego. So unconditional love or compassion cannot develop without dispassion to one&#039;s self interest. So compassion and dispassion coexist.'),(7,10,'What is a good way to express love that isn&#039;t through the ego?','Love is an expression of ego but when it is unconditional and unselfish, that is pure love or universal love.'),(8,10,'How can you focus on universal love as a form of meditation?','In a form of peace. When restlessness of the mind subsides,, that is peace and that is meditation.'),(9,10,'Where does Krishna live now?','Krishna lives in the devotional actions of the devotees. Krishna represents the higher self within. Without the higher self within, no activity is possible.'),(10,10,'Could you talk a little more about devotion to our spiritual ideals?','We create our spiritual ideals or spiritual disciplines. As long as we devotedly practice those disciplines, we will not get snatched by worldliness. First comes the aim. Then you carry the lantern of will power. The path you tread is full of thorns, rocks, and so on. You wear the shoes of faith and devotion. Will, faith, and devotion together take you to the destination.'),(1,11,'Are there any forms of God that are better for meditation than others?','Anything that binds the mind to God is right. It is called devotional path. God is without name and form. But human mind can&#039;t work without using the form. So we create a form for God and we choose a human form because it is the highest form in creation. Then we use symbols to make that form more divine.'),(2,11,'In the scriptures, different forms of God are extolled. What is the best form?','A finite form is easy to grasp. The formless mind (a mind with supreme dispassion) can relate to the formless. But finite mind cannot relate to a formless infinite God. In Jnana Yoga, formless infinite God is defined in negative terms, &quot;not this, not this&quot;. The form liked by a devotee is the best. A devotee who likes God in a female form will create God in a female form, or one who likes a male form will create a male form.'),(3,11,'So it&#039;s not necessarily wrong to worship a form of God? It&#039;s something that we use as a vehicle?','Yes, worshipping God in a form is a method which is easier than worshipping formless God. God is infinite. No one can imagine God in full. Every person, according to one&#039;s nature, creates an idea of God and worships that God. The form given to God is symbolic of infinite nature of God. For example, Krishna is given blue color. Blue color represents infinite space.'),(4,11,'Everything not finite must be infinite.','Yes. Also, infinite becomes finite. Without infinite consciousness, finite can&#039;t exist. Formless takes the form. When consciousness unites with prakriti, it is with a form.'),(5,11,'It seems that we all have strengths and weaknesses that show more and less of God&#039;s energy. How can God&#039;s energy be shining in some aspects and not in others?','Both negative and positive energies come from God or cosmic conscious principle. There is no total good or total bad. In any object, the energy which is felt more clearly indicates God&#039;s energy. No object can exist without God&#039;s energy in it, but some objects are more receptive of God&#039;s energy and that energy is seen more shining.'),(6,11,'The negative energies such as anger, fear and pain are very intense at times. You can see and feel them. Can the divine energy in them be meditated on directly in order to resolve or deal with them?','They are divine energies when the ego does not possess them. When the ego expresses itself in a negative way, they are ego energies. If the ego is removed from negative thoughts, then they can&#039;t harm the individual. Meditating on them means removing ego involvement.'),(7,11,'The Gita talks about the higher nature of God forgetting its God nature and identifying with its lower nature and thus becoming the embodied soul. How can part of God forget?','&quot;God forgets&quot;: it means when the infinite consciousness appears as finite, as embodied God, then there is no awareness of its real nature. The pure conscious principle reflects in the buddhi (or intellect) principle. That reflected consciousness is the jiva or God within. That embodied God forgets its real nature (omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent).'),(8,11,'Is meditating on the Self the same as worship of the Gods?','Yes. The Self is embodied God who is continuously working with the mind, intellect and senses to function in the world. In meditation, when the mind, intellect and senses are withdrawn from the world, then the embodied God is no other than the infinite, eternal God.'),(9,11,'We have been taught that God is beyond conception and cannot be known by the mind, but in the Gita tangible attributes are attributed to God.','Infinite takes form as finite. Only the finite form is known and explained with attributes. The infinite remains unexplainable.'),(10,11,'In the finite forms that show God&#039;s presence, it&#039;s easier to understand the victory, the determination, etc., than the cunning, being involved in deceit, etc.','Finite includes both pairs of opposites. If God is all in all, then both positive and negative qualities in the mind would come from God. The ego or I-amness owns both. The ego in its pure state (that is not working through the mind) is pure conscious principle or God. When the ego is working in alliance with the mind, it only creates worldly desires. If it&#039;s not in alliance with the mind, then it is established in its own pure state, the Self. God is neither cunning nor deceitful. In stories, such nature is given to God only to show that for the good of humanity that too is needed.'),(1,12,'When people talk about ego, they usually speak of it as an entity. Is it an entity or a process?','Ego is neither an entity nor a process. It is only a notion of I-amness which exists in the mind. The process of reducing the ego is for the mind and not for the ego itself, although we talk about the ego as separate. It never exists without the mind. If a person is senseless, the person doesn&#039;t know about his or her state. I-amness is dormant.'),(2,12,'You said earlier that the reduction of ego is for the mind and not for the ego itself. Could you clarify what you mean by that?','Ego, the idea of I-am, is in the mind. It is rajas guna predominant, which is the energy of passion. Mind is rajas guna predominant. It develops greed, pride, attachment, fear, etc. The ego only owns all those things in the mind by saying &quot;I am.&quot; When the mind is removed from worldly desires, then sattva guna gets stronger. In sattva guna, the ego can&#039;t express itself. If we want to understand the ego, then we have to look back. All our past pain and miseries are still there, whereas our good works are in a faint memory. It proves that expression of ego is more in tamas and rajas-based actions and thoughts.'),(3,12,'I am interested in the idea of dharma as being our nature, that our nature as a human being is to say &quot;I am.&quot;','&quot;I am&quot; is the nature of the mind. In that nature, two things are hidden: 1) bhoga (experience), 2) apavarga (liberation). In bhoga there are 2 stages: 1) dharmic experiences (virtuous experiences) and 2) adharmic (nonvirtuous experiences or vice). People experience all kinds of enjoyments by using evil means. A hunter finds joy in shooting an innocent deer.'),(4,12,'Is it necessary to first have an ego in order to experience and then the feel of the ego sinking becomes the seed of your spiritual path or the foundation of one&#039;s liberation?','It&#039;s not our choice to have the ego or not. We are born with it. It is the nature of the mind to experience its individuality. All our desires, attachment, experiences in the world are due to the ego based in the mind. When all worldly experiences appear as pain, then the ego-based mind seeks for liberation. When we say liberation, we mean the experiencer within us, the ego of individuality (jiva), starts seeking for its own liberation from all the memories of past experiences.'),(5,12,'Could it be said that any seeking is from the ego? The play of the ego, the desire for self improvement? Is it just the personality which seeks the truth; is that just an expression of the ego?','Yes. It&#039;s also an expression of ego but heading towards its own dissolution The ego, ahamkara, means that which creates I-ness. It has no other meaning. It has no particular place in our body but it is rooted in all the activities of the mind, intellect, and senses. So we can&#039;t deal with the ego without using our mind.'),(6,12,'How is the desire to self improve heading towards its own dissolution&quot;?','Go back to the past. You did good things and also bad things. Bad things are in your mind very clearly. Good things are almost forgotten. How? Because in bad things the ego expresses its presence strongly and in good things it can&#039;t. In good things the ego relates to the universal concept; in bad things only in terms of the individual. In self improvement, you try to live a virtuous life, and virtuous life removes egoic involvement in the world.'),(7,12,'&quot;We are already there; we just don&#039;t know it,&quot; the Buddhists say. Would you comment?','&quot;We are already there.&quot; It means the divine energy is within each of us all the time. &quot;We don&#039;t know it&quot; means our ego of individuality is veiling that truth. As long as the notion of individuality is not removed, we are our ego. But it&#039;s a theory. The question is how? Doing our duty for others is one way. What happens? The ego is the concept of I-ness. It always thinks of self-interest. Self-interest needs two things: 1) desire, 2) attachment. How do we think we are? By our actions, thoughts and feelings which are only for our self-interest. If we change the angle of the mind, we are doing our duty for others without attachment: 1) my family, 2) my friends, 3) my job, 4) my property. If the attitude should be all for others, I am simply doing caretaker duty. When the mind takes that attitude, the ego loses its power.'),(8,12,'You have said the ego gets subtler and subtler as you progress on the spiritual path. Does this happen through the practice of spiritual discipline?','By spiritual practice, by devotion, by study of scriptures, by the teachings of a sage, the ego becomes subtler. What is subtler ego? The gross ego is the ego of individuality which expresses itself in worldly desires and attachment. Subtler ego is when those desires and attachment get weaker and individual self-interests start disappearing. The mind identifies with the subtle ego by its own pure state.'),(9,12,'How do you recognize the subtler aspect of ego, because it&#039;s so subtle?','By seeing the dispassion in the mind.'),(10,12,'The term &quot;universal ego,&quot; is that the Self or is that something different?','The Self unrelated to one&#039;s worldly existence. &quot;I&quot; - universal; &quot;I am&quot; - individual which is always involved with worldly objects.'),(11,12,'How can one tell whether one is operating from universal ego or individual ego?','By watching our self interest &quot;It&#039;s for me, it&#039;s not for me.&quot; This idea is in the individual ego.'),(12,12,'Is it possible to live in the world without a sense of I?','If you mean &quot;I am,&quot; then yes. It is a state of desirelessness. If you don&#039;t want anything and are contented within yourself, you will not feel &quot;I am.&quot; The individuality transforms to universality.'),(13,12,'What is higher ego as opposed to lower ego? Is there a freedom at either level?','Ego is English term for I-ness and I-amness. I-ness is higher ego. I-amness is the lower ego. &quot;I am&quot; relates to an object. &quot;I&quot; doesn&#039;t relate to anything. It is self-existing consciousness. So we use higher ego and lower ego. In Sanskrit it is atma and jiva. Jiva means one who is living in the body. Soul and oversoul is another term.'),(14,12,'In the process of separating the ego, I find I close up in other ways. And separate myself from friendship and close down to love.','It doesn&#039;t separate anything if one understands the ego and its expression in so many various ways. You remain the same person but you don&#039;t feel the same way and the drama goes on. You own a house and a boy throws a rock and breaks the window glass. You curse the boy and throw a rock at him. Then you sell the house and then rent it. Again a boy comes and throws a rock and breaks the window glass. You see it and say, &quot;oh, the owner will fix it.&quot; Only change was the sense of ownership changed.'),(15,12,'So the shutting down is still part of the ego&#039;s involvement?','You are still living in the same house, but you sold the ownership. You became a tenant. In your mind you feel like a tenant but your outer functions in the house remain the same.'),(16,12,'Regarding the appearance of the divine when self-interest is eliminated, is it a matter of understanding the boundaries of the Self or eliminating the Self entirely?','Appearance of the divine means Self-realization. What is that realization? I am not this mind-body complex. I am the Self, a divine spark existing in all beings. So I am universal.&quot;'),(1,13,'How do you know what path to begin on?','In this Yuga, Karma Yoga is the best path. Action for the good of this creation. Karma Yoga means union with God through selfless service. Mother Teresa is a very good example of Karma Yoga path. Everyone can&#039;t do what Mother Teresa did but everyone can practice Karma Yoga in life in some degree.'),(2,13,'Arjuna&#039;s challenge was to accept his duty. How is one able to determine one&#039;s right job in the world?','It is called dharma. Dharma means nature-born quality. It also means duty or religion. Arjuna&#039;s duty was very clear. He was a prince and a warrior, so he always knew he had to fight. But it&#039;s not clear to common people what is their particular duty or dharma. Why is it not clear? Because the mind is in a restless state and can&#039;t see itself. If one is capable to make the mind calm and balanced, then dharma will shine by itself. Arjuna in the battlefield forgot his dharma and was ready to renounce the world. Krishna rebuked in a gentle way and said &quot;if you renounce your duty, then your nature-born quality will pull you back into fighting. So do your duty and you will attain liberation.&quot;'),(3,13,'Arjuna had the duty because he was born a prince and a warrior. Here we are directed by parental or societal pressures to follow a particular path. What if one has other desires?','Everyone is born as someone with nature-born quality. The agitated state of the mind doesn&#039;t see it. The restless mind sees &quot;this is better; now this is better&quot; and so on. Parents guide their children when they are small; then social pressure possesses the mind in the society. But there can&#039;t be any pressure for your independent thinking.'),(4,13,'I find it difficult to discriminate between my desires and the highest desires. How do we choose right action?','It&#039;s always hard as long as the mind is not pure. Our mind is in a restless state; it means discontented, always wanting, needing, possessing. So we don&#039;t have choice as long as the mind is not purified by living a virtuous life. In all religions they preach about living a virtuous life.'),(5,13,'What happens if you are doing your duty with the best of intentions and someone gets hurt along the way?','Motive behind the action brings its positive or negative result. Your intention is good but when you are doing good for the whole society, a few persons may get hurt because their personal interest is not fulfilled. You are not doing Karma Yoga to please certain people but you are doing it for the good of the whole creation.'),(6,13,'People say there is a quality of joy in doing what you are born to do. Is that true?','It&#039;s a joy when the samskaras are working out in a positive way. A hunter also experiences joy but this joy is not positive. An artist, a poet, a mathematician, etc. who are born with these qualities enjoy doing their work. It is rather flowing with the work.'),(7,13,'Isn&#039;t there a light and a joy in the work that we perform as Karma Yoga through which we can identify it in ourselves or in others?','Karma Yoga is chosen. It is not forced on anyone so there is no need to know if someone is doing Karma Yoga or not. The yoga term in India or in the scriptures is used for meditation. But by adding &quot;karma&quot; to it, the meaning is yoga meditation with action. Meditation and action are two opposites. But here when self-interest is removed, there is unity in opposites.'),(8,13,'Can we consider our livelihood as being our Karma Yoga?','Yes. Empty stomach - no karma yoga. But we have to see how much we give and how much we take.'),(9,13,'I am still not clear about how Karma Yoga can quiet the mind. In the moment I am totally present with what I am doing but as soon as I am sitting quietly my mind is no longer quiet.','The mind is disturbed by selfish desires. Our mind is filled by thoughts and worries when we work with self-interest. In Karma Yoga the ego is not attached to any undertaking for its self- interest. This makes Karma Yoga meditation in action.'),(10,13,'Any kind of thinking, usually something about the past or the future.','Anything of your past is related to you and any plan for the future is also related to you. So your ego is living in the past memories and future plans. What about the present which is a reality?'),(11,13,'The present is when I am doing something.','You are doing but living in the past and future.'),(12,13,'When I am in action, I am feeling in the present. When I stop and sit, my mind goes to the past and future.','Then don&#039;t stop! (laughter) When you are doing something with a selfish desire, the mind is fluctuating in past, present and future. Like a chess player is very concentrated but the mind is fluctuating in thinking about the consequences of any move.'),(13,13,'What if you are doing your duty and you notice there is some self-interest? What is the correct response?','In the beginning no one can start from a completely selfless state of mind. During the practice of Karma Yoga, different kinds of pollution appear but if the aim is stable, then one can go beyond all pollution. We should not expect that our Karma Yoga is 100% selfless. But the process of Karma Yoga reduces self-interest gradually.'),(14,13,'Dealing with money complicates Karma Yoga for me. We have been taught that the fruits of our labor are money. Also what about teaching children about wealth?','It&#039;s hard to understand the spirit of Karma Yoga. Nonattachment, desirelessness, etc. are in the mind. The mind is molded in Karma Yoga philosophy. It doesn&#039;t say don&#039;t make money, don&#039;t buy a car, etc. You have to function in a society, in a family, so you need everything. You own a house. If someone throws a rock and breaks the window glass, you feel very upset in your heart. You sell the house and rent it. If someone throws a rock, you don&#039;t get upset. The living situation is not changed. Everything is the same, but mental conditioning is changed. Karma Yoga molds the mind in nonattached living. It doesn&#039;t happen overnight. It takes one&#039;s whole life to practice.'),(15,13,'Sometimes in a community setting, a situation comes up where the person has a talent for something but the community needs that person to do something else. How can that be worked out fairly?','Using a person&#039;s talent in a right way is better than using an engineer&#039;s energy in breaking rocks. But when there is a need of something to be done, then every member of the community together does it. The person with a particular talent should accept the need of the community.'),(16,13,'When you feel unhappy in your life and pain comes, and you see that others are unhappy and in pain, then you want to do Karma Yoga to get out of it. How can you really do Karma Yoga when the desire to be happy and the desire for love is so strong?','Desire to be happy is a natural thing in all human beings. But the mind likes to be in pain by bringing the past memories and not seeing any progress in the future. If we dwell on the negative side of the mind, then we can&#039;t be happy in any situation. Karma Yoga is one of the ways to remove the pain caused by attachment and expectation. A patient of malaria can&#039;t avoid quinine pill no matter how bitter it is. Karma Yoga can be hard at first but we have to do it.'),(1,14,'The Gita verse (XV:11) described the two different kinds of aspirants (with pure and impure mind). Both aspirants practice the methods so what is the key as to whether the aspirant who practices can actually purify the mind?','What are the impurities of the mind? Moha (delusion), vasana (desire, passion), ahamkara (egoism). Dispassion and knowledge alone purifies the mind and not the practice. Sadhana practice with no dispassion and no knowledge is simply a work for the mind and body. Devotion comes first. When an aspirant develops nonattachment to the world, worldly desires decrease and one becomes humble in relating to others. It means the mind is purified. Purified mind develops deep concentration and becomes peaceful.'),(2,14,'Could you give an example how if two people sit down to practice pranayama, one gets samadhi and the other doesn&#039;t? How does knowledge and dispassion in the one that gets samadhi cause the person&#039;s mind to go deeper?','Deep ocean divers don&#039;t get samadhi. They can hold the breath for 3-5 minutes. In pranayama, concentration is the main key. If in doing pranayama, the mind is restless and agitated, then pranayama will not do much good.'),(3,14,'But both practitioners are trying to dive deep.','One is doing by awareness; one is not.'),(4,14,'The difference between the two aspirants is that one has acquired knowledge and dispassion and the other hasn&#039;t?','It is not the knowledge of the Self. It&#039;s a knowledge of one&#039;s firm aim which develops devotion and dispassion.'),(5,14,'Is that the knowledge that causes one to have success?','Yes. That goes with dispassion. Progress is based on dispassion and devotion.'),(6,14,'You said one does pranayama with awareness and the other doesn&#039;t, so my mind thought on the awareness of the breath. So it&#039;s better to concentrate the awareness at ajna?','Awareness of the breath in pranayama breathing is important.'),(7,14,'There&#039;s a difference between concentration at ajna and being aware of the flow of the breath.','Awareness of breath is also concentration. One cannot keep awareness of one object if the mind jumps around in various things.'),(8,14,'So should one start with concentration on the breath?','Yes. In doing pranayama, you have to be aware of breath and you can fix the mind at ajna chakra. In pranayama, the breathing pattern is not the same as we breathe at other times. It is a yogic breathing which is measured by the time of inhale, hold, and exhale.'),(9,14,'Do different pranayama have better methods of concentration specific to the pranayama?','All pranayamas purify the mind, move the pranic energy upward, and develop the ability of concentration. One doesn&#039;t need to do all kinds of pranayamas. One or two kinds can be perfected by regular practice.'),(10,14,'Does the knowledge that we are talking about that helps you to go deeper in meditation, does that come from meditation?','Yes. The process of meditation is to remove the world from the mind. When the world subsides from the mind, even for a short period, it brings two things: 1) knowledge of the truth in degrees, 2) dispassion for the unreal world. Those two things again in the next meditation deepen its intensity. In one meditation, it&#039;s very hard to go into samadhi. Only those who have very high dispassion can go into samadhi that way.'),(11,14,'So is the transfer from meditation to meditation accomplished by weakening the worldly samskaras or is there an imprint that transfers forward to reinforce the succeeding meditations?','The five afflictions are the inner world. Avidya (ignorance), asmita (egoism), raga (attraction), dvesha (repulsion), abhinivesha (fear of death or clinging to life). They are in the mind and due to them, we identify the outer world. They are weakened by regular practice of meditation. The more those samskaras are weakened, the more one goes deeper in meditation.'),(12,14,'Is the veil of ignorance the belief in those kleshas? What is the veil of ignorance?','We are born with a belief: &quot;I am this mind-body complex.&quot; It&#039;s our ignorance and the other kleshas reinforce this ignorance.'),(13,14,'In the imprinting process of meditation that creates the samskara of one- pointedness or restraint, is it the accumulation of those one-pointed samskaras that burn the other samskaras that destroys the notion of the outer world? Is there a cause and effect relationship from the meditation to the outer world samskaras?','Any action in which the mind is aware makes samskaras. Meditation is action. That makes samskaras. That samskara becomes the cause of the intensity of the next meditation. So it&#039;s a cause and effect process.'),(14,14,'Given that, to what extent does that development of the samskara of meditation affect the samskara of attachment, greed, etc. directed to the outer world.','Samskara are accumulated in the mind. When the samskara of meditation starts increasing, the worldly samskaras are blocked from getting active by meditation samskara. What are meditation samskaras? 1) Knowledge (viveka) and 2) dispassion (vairagya). Knowledge is opposite of ignorance and dispassion is opposite of attachment.'),(1,15,'What is the meaning of life?','Meaning of life is to experience the world and then to remove all the memories of the experience to attain eternal peace. So, experience and eternal peace are two objects of life. Why? Because it is in human nature. We want both. Animals only know about experience. The concept of eternal peace is not in their minds.'),(2,15,'Could you clarify the difference between enlightenment and liberation?','Enlightenment is knowledge attained through the pure mind. In each samadhi state the mind purifies and the mind is capable to see more reality of an object. In a dual state there are four levels of samadhi. In non-dual state there is one.'),(3,15,'What are the different levels of samadhi?','Samprajnata = dual state.  Savitarka samadhi = samadhi with gross object. Savichara samadhi = samadhi with subtle object. Sananda samadhi = the mind is the object. Sasmita samadhi = the ego is the object.  In the non-dual state, kaivalya = complete isolated state.'),(4,15,'When one is seeking the truth in the Kali Yuga and doesn&#039;t attain, is it possible to wait for the Satya Yuga?','Liberation is not time-bound. It can happen now or after several births. Liberation from what? We use this term &quot;liberation&quot; but we don&#039;t think on its meaning. We are in a prison of our own self-created desires and attachments which are the means of enjoyment. If desires and attachments in the present, together with all its past memories, are removed, liberation is right there. Can it happen to everyone? In time, but not all at once. Why don&#039;t we get non-attached when we know it&#039;s the cause of our bondage? It&#039;s because worldly attachments are real and liberation is just a theory for us.'),(5,15,'If everyone eventually gets enlightened, then would people stop coming?','Bhoga and apavarga (experience and liberation from all experiences) are both in human nature. Bhoga is our present action and past memories. Apavarga is in the future when the past and present is disconnected from the future. If every person gets liberated, then there will be no creation. The lower species will evolve to higher stages. So it is impossible that some day everyone will get liberated. The process of evolution and involution is eternal.'),(6,15,'It&#039;s said to be easy to seek liberation by focusing our attention on God. Krishna says, &quot;focus your mind on Me.&quot; After one has focused the mind on God, is it easy to attain liberation?','Suppose God is sitting on the other side of the mountain. You climb the mountain with much effort. When you reach the top, then just slide down. In climbing your mind is one-pointed on the idea of God.'),(7,15,'Yet the Yoga Sutras says that Yoga is controlling of the thought waves in the mind, which sounds like there is effort all the way to the end?','There is effort in both. Focusing attention on God is not so easy. The mind is pulled by so many egocentric desires all the time.'),(8,15,'Could we reach the top and then stay there without sliding?','On reaching the top, the mind is so purified that it automatically merges in God.'),(9,15,'Does the Bodhisattva ideal not recognize the dual aspect? In non-dual state, who can go or come?','(Nods yes.) Dualistic. We can say partial liberation and final liberation. According to the Gita, in final liberation the wheel of birth and death stops.'),(10,15,'Could one reach a high level of enlightenment and a partial liberation, then stay and serve while holding back from final liberation?','Holding back is not in one&#039;s hand. Unless one keeps the ego.'),(11,15,'Isn&#039;t it a higher ideal to serve others than to get free&quot;?','It&#039;s a great motivation to serve others whether enlightened or not enlightened. In the Gita it is said &quot;what is left for a liberated person except to serve others?&quot;'),(12,15,'In full liberation the ego dissolves completely? Then would there be no body, no way to live in this world?','Prarabdha karma still works. Like a fruit about to ripen. If kept in a basket it will continue to ripen. But one time will come when it will be ripened completely. So those enlightened sages may take birth to work out the prarabdha karma. Enlightenment is in degrees. If we say liberated one,&quot; then the question of using ego doesn&#039;t arise because that being is functioning by the force of nature.'),(13,15,'Service and meditation are called two wings on the bird rising to the divine. Sometimes people get out of balance. They might meditate a lot but have no love for others, for example. Is it a completely individual thing or is there a balance that should be kept?','All humans are not alike. They have different kinds of understandings, faith and belief. They create their own path to reach for the divine. How to balance? Everyone sticks to his or her own path. Some believe meditation is the only way. Some believe service is the only way. Any belief will lead to the same goal. An atheist believes everything is right here; there is no God. Live a virtuous life and you will attain peace. It cannot be contradicted. Those who cry &quot;God, God&quot; they can&#039;t prove there is God. Those who say &quot;no God,&quot; they can&#039;t prove there is no God. So again both are the same. But when the mind is purified by any method, the result is the same &quot;eternal peace&quot; or God, whatever you name it.'),(14,15,'When the devotees of Christ and Krishna worship to get to heaven or Vaikuntha, is there really a place where they go?','I don&#039;t know but the idea is charming because it fulfills the idea &quot;I may live forever.&quot; We want to live forever no matter how we live. If God comes here and says &quot;anyone who wants liberation now but you have to die now,&quot; no one would raise their hand. It&#039;s so beautiful here. What is in liberation? Somewhere sitting in a dark place. Heaven and hell are living in virtuous and non-virtuous ways.'),(15,15,'What is the best way to approach the disturbances to meditation, when ego itself is desiring apavarga and still is entertaining the interrupting thoughts?','The aspirant wants liberation but doesn&#039;t want to work for it whole-heartedly. If we want to win in a contest, for example, volleyball, every player is completely concentrated. They become one body. Because the want is so intense. Liberation is a philosophy: maybe true, maybe not. What will we get by liberation? As long as we don&#039;t get some experience of liberation, the mind will create thoughts. When there is intense faith, intense dispassion and firm aim, worldly thoughts will not disturb the meditation.'),(16,15,'Could you share your personal feeling about God, if it is not too personal?','The eternal peace. In that peace, everything shines up in its reality. No illusion. God is defined by three words: Sat (existence), Chit (consciousness), Ananda (bliss or peace).'),(1,16,'Previously I had meditation practice that would create more lights and visualizations and different meditative symbols. Now it&#039;s more just an awareness of a vastness like an openness or a cave.','Visualizations, lights, animals, appearance of a saint are not so important as the peace that pervades the mind.'),(2,16,'Do they use these words just to scare people into doing good actions or do they have a symbolic meaning also?','The hell is given different categories. In the Puranas, they are mentioned that if a person does this or that thing, they will go to this or that hell. Hell and heaven in Yoga are not after death, but while we are living. A person in miseries often cries out &quot;I am living in hell.&quot; Hell is a notion that our mind has created. Pain and miseries is hell; peace and happiness are heaven.'),(3,16,'If one is meditating in order to bring some benefit to the Self, of the rajasic type with self-interest involved, doesn&#039;t meditation help us overcome selfishness?','Meditation always starts from rajasic state of mind called vikshipta, the restless state of mind. The aim is to bring peace. The mind gets purified by meditation. The samadhi state comes gradually. Otherwise everyone would start by samadhi right away.'),(4,16,'If the goal is to give up attachments, both material and ideological, doesn&#039;t peace itself become a desire? How does it differ from other attachments and desires?','Peace is the result of nonattachment.'),(5,16,'It&#039;s said that &quot;If you want peace, my child, see no one&#039;s faults. Make the world your own.&quot;','Right, but how? As long as the mind is not sattvic, the mind will see everything as colored by negativities. Only one&#039;s own idea feels right.'),(6,16,'I understand a little bit about service and self-interest, but how can you plan a building without interest in the outcome?','Without using the mind, nothing is done. The mind&#039;s nature is to plan whether you are attached or not attached. The wise work with the same intensity as one who is attached but they are not attached.'),(7,16,'How do you know whether or not you are attached?','If we are unattached, our mind will be at peace in profit and loss.'),(1,17,'About the narrow path of nonattachment. Is it suggesting that the loneliness that each of us feels should be embraced, that it&#039;s really the reality? To attain that peace you walk through very narrow lane of nonattachment. On that lane only one can walk.','No one can share the path of liberation. Everyone creates one&#039;s own path. If ten people meditate together, will their minds stay on the same level? No, their latencies (samskaras) will put them on different levels.'),(2,17,'I think that one reason for craving is to fulfill survival needs and another level of craving is to cover up the loneliness. In our culture we have decided to say that only what we see and feel is real. Is this state of being alone really the reality that we all have to accept? Is that experience peaceful when we have accepted it? Should one look to being alone as the source of peace?','Alone in the mind and not in our physical living situation.'),(3,17,'That can be pretty crowded.','It is crowded. You have to sneak out by understanding the spirit of nonattachment.'),(1,18,'I understand that Krishna represents higher consciousness and Arjuna is the jiva, or embodied soul. Is Arjuna upset because he sees his attachments and knows he has to let go of the negative qualities in the form of the Kauravas?','The ego of individuality is equally attached to negative qualities as to positive qualities. In negative qualities, the ego feels its presence more. If you think back to your own life, you will remember all the bad actions or the bad things that happened to you more than the good things. Why do they come up? Because we feel attached to our own ego self. Arjuna was upset to see the disastrous result of the war.'),(2,18,'Arjuna becomes paralyzed by his emotion. How does he move from that state to one where he can begin to act again?','Arjuna went with a revengeful mind to fight. In the battlefield, Krishna&#039;s one word hit Arjuna deeply: &quot;Behold, O Arjuna, the Kurus in the battlefield.&quot; Kauravas and Pandavas both were from Kuru clan. What happened to Buddha who never saw a sick person or an old person? When he saw them, his mind was filled with pain. So the pain in life creates a ladder of life in spirituality. It was purposefully used by Krishna to create pain in Arjuna. The chariot was stationed in such a place from which Arjuna could see his most loved ones like Bhishma and Drona. So naturally the pain created a deep emotional state in Arjuna. Arjuna needed to know with whom he is actually fightingnot the enemy but his own clan.'),(3,18,'If Arjuna were coming to the battlefield with a desire to fight, why would Krishna create this pain in him to incapacitate him and then tell him to fight?','Krishna considered Arjuna as a friend and disciple, so he wanted to turn his mind from revenge to spiritual nature. Symbolically, the jivahood or the individual soul is always fighting for its self-interest and sinking deep down into worldliness. Our pure conscious principle knows it but doesn&#039;t want to see it because the other side is immediate self-gratification. So in that state, we either need high dispassion to develop by the grace of God or some outside agency comes and whips us. Krishna did what Arjuna needed.'),(4,18,'So we all have to fight the battle of life. Most of us are fighting on the basis of self-interest, and Krishna is now waking him up to fight selflessly?','Arjuna fought many battles and got the name Dananjaya, conqueror of wealth. So wealth did not bring contentment in him. Now he was fighting with his own clan or with his own mind which was filled by negative and positive qualities. His self-interest and his attachment created confusion in his mind.'),(5,18,'Does this lead us to conclude that it&#039;s not so much what you are doing as the intention behind what you are doing?','All actions create samskaras according to the intention behind it. You walk and an ant gets crushed. You do not know it so you did not kill the ant. Any action performed with a motive behind it becomes your action.'),(6,18,'You have said that in order to know the Self, you have to know the ego. By asking to see the opposing army, is Arjuna setting himself up to look at his own negative qualities and his own ego?','Symbolically, in the battlefield the enemies were his own negative nature. We see what we are. But at this point, he developed dispassion so even though he considered them enemies, he is also thinking of its destructive ending.'),(7,18,'But Krishna is encouraging him to kill other human beings.','If we see it historically, Arjuna is the prince whose nature-born quality is to fight and whose duty is to protect the kingdom from atrocities. So fighting was the only way. Symbolically, if we don&#039;t fight with our negative qualities, then they will overpower us.'),(8,18,'Could you elaborate on the idea that avoiding negative thoughts could be harmful?','Avoiding means not paying attention to them and not doing anything to remove them. If a pigeon closes her eyes when the cat attacks, it will not save her life. Only the cat will not be seen. If the negative thoughts are not controlled and removed, then they will create negative actions that harm the person and others.'),(9,18,'In the Gita, does Krishna expect Arjuna to kill without anger?','Krishna is telling Arjuna to look inside at his own enemies, fight with them, and remove them from his life. In a battle no one kills a particular person. They just fight and people get killed.'),(10,18,'Did Krishna stay silent so that Arjuna would work out his own problem?','Krishna wanted Arjuna to vomit out all of his mental garbage so his mind could be pulled in a right understanding. If Krishna would argue, then it would create more arguments. So Krishna listened to what Arjuna is saying and did not express his opinion. It frustrated Arjuna and he started giving various reasons and exhausted himself.  Why couldn&#039;t Arjuna just forget his family? So then he wouldn&#039;t need to fight. 1) Arjuna came to fight with the belief that he will win and get his kingdom back. 2) As a prince, his duty was to remove the suffering of his subjects who were under Duryodhana&#039;s rule. It would not be right to forgive a tyrant king.'),(11,18,'Was Arjuna motivated by something more than just fear?','Arjuna saw the consequences of war. It was a war within his own tribe, so he thought about it from all angles and thought it was not right to battle with his own tribe. He did not consider his nature as a warrior which would come out in other ways if he refrains from war now. He did not consider the condition of his subjects who were suffering. He forgot his responsibility for his subjects. He was not afraid of war. His fear as to the outcome of the war.'),(12,18,'As an allegory, how do these verses relate to the inner battle within us?','Ego of individuality - jivahood. The embodied self is in prison in the mind-body complex and strives for its freedom. Without a battle, it cannot get free.'),(13,18,'So is Arjuna coming up with reasons for the ego to avoid doing battle?','Ego sees its attachment. The ego lives as long as there is attachment. Arjuna was avoiding the battle to see his own teachers, brothers and loved ones will be killed. All those people reinforce his ego by his attachment to them.'),(14,18,'When Arjuna says we may destroy the whole civilization and whole culture, does this refer to the destruction of duality?','Destroying the culture, country and people, etc., doesn&#039;t destroy duality. Symbolically, the Kauravas represent the negative aspect of mind. Arjuna was in duality and attached to duality. That is why he did not want to fight. Krishna is forcing him to fight for his own liberation. Liberation means non-dual state.'),(15,18,'Is it the duality that Arjuna is fighting? I don&#039;t understand the nature of the battle.','Duality exists as long as one is guided by one&#039;s egocentric mind. Arjuna as an historical prince was fighting for his rightful claim of the kingdom. Symbolically, Arjuna the jiva, the ego of individuality, was fighting for his liberation which is also his rightful claim, fighting with his own negative aspect of mind. All battles take place in duality.'),(16,18,'How can we know there is not an Arjuna on the other side of the battle who has the right to fight for his own liberation and his rightful claim to the kingdom?','On the other side there were Bhishma, Drona, etc., the great teachers. Some were enlightened and some were on the way to enlightenment. The question is why such great teachers took the side of the Kauravas. The positive and negative minds are in every person. When we do something wrong, deep inside the mind knows and resists it. But when the negative mind is stronger, then the positive mind goes along with it. Historically every citizen of that country was supposed to fight for the sake of the king. That was the rule. Even though learned teachers were of Kauravas side but they had no self-interest. They were fighting as a duty.'),(17,18,'When he throws down his bow, that seems good to me. Are you saying that he should fight, that it&#039;s better to fight?','If we don&#039;t fight with our negative thoughts, actions, and feelings, then the mind will get possessed by them. Even historically it wouldn&#039;t be right if Arjuna would refrain from the war. He was commander-in-chief and war was about to start.'),(1,19,'How do we respond to family members who are critical and who are judging our involvement with the yogic tradition and the deities involved in that tradition? How can I deal with people who make negative judgments about our family&#039;s choices?','Everyone defends his or her own beliefs. This battle never ends. In fact, the truth is one and explained in different languages. Debates and arguments did not solve anything for thousands of years and will not solve anything in the future. Your family members have their own beliefs and want you to squeeze yourself to fit in the same mold they are molded. Stick to your beliefs and don&#039;t attack someone else&#039;s beliefs.'),(2,19,'Along those lines, any discipline or faith needs a focus or belief. We have different philosophies in which we invest our faith to realize the truth of teachings that we haven&#039;t yet experienced. So it&#039;s important to have those symbols and faith and yet we know they are not the ultimate. If we say that everything is the same, then we don&#039;t have a path to walk on.','To start the journey, you take a path and start walking. The deeper you go the more the paths start merging in one. Is there any difference for the realized one whether someone worships gods, deities, or just worships one God with a form or formless? Different philosophies give an understanding of seeing the same truth through different angles.'),(3,19,'Most religions, including both the Christian and the Jewish, don&#039;t make graven images and don&#039;t worship images.','Yes, Jewish, Christians and Mohammedans do not use any form of God. In Hinduism the form is used as a symbol which indicates a particular divine energy.'),(4,19,'You mean it&#039;s impossible to visualize God without some image or book?','Who doesn&#039;t worship God without a symbol? Symbols are an indicator of God&#039;s energy and not gods by themselves. Road signs indicate the path to a town and not the town itself. The alphabets of all languages are symbols of particular sound. So we live and function by using symbols.'),(5,19,'In the Catholic faith, there are a lot of saints such as patron saints of healing, travel, art, etc. People pray to them to intercede with God. The deities serve as an intermediate being between God and ourselves.','Everything is a reminder. We are lost in the world and when we see a mosque, a church, a deity, it reminds us that there is God, whether there is God or not but it wakes us up.'),(6,19,'Is it important to determine exactly which category (Karma, Bhakti, Jnana) we ourselves are practicing?','Karma Yoga is mixed in Bhakti and Jnana because any mental and physical activity, devotion or knowledge can&#039;t be practiced. Those who are naturally more devotional, their devotion predominates in any method that they practice. Similarly, knowledge predominates in the activities of intellectuals.'),(7,19,'If one is living a spiritual life with the aim of peace and one&#039;s relationship is full of confusion and arguments, how can one keep the aim of feeling of peace?','Disagreement creates arguments. Two people together create this situation and both defend their ego. If they don&#039;t learn to compromise, the fight doesn&#039;t stop and they live in disharmony and emotional pain and sadness. So to live in peace, the living situation must change.'),(8,19,'A person&#039;s dharma is said to be based on one&#039;s past actions. If one has a teacher who can instruct one as to one&#039;s dharma, that is one situation. Most people don&#039;t have such a teacher; they are caught in survival and desire. How are such people to understand dharma?','Dharma term means things like religion, duty, nature, but its real meaning is nature-born qualities. Like the sun&#039;s dharma is heat and light. Here we are using the meaning &quot;duty.&quot; It&#039;s hard to understand one&#039;s duty when the mind is confused and deluded so we need some outer guidance. If such guidance is not available and a person has a spiritual mind, then in time the mind will be purified by the person&#039;s spiritual practice.'),(9,19,'Even if we have guidance, we have difficulty in following the instructions.','Yes, the path is hard. Many setbacks appear time to time. But one who has a firm aim can make it.'),(10,19,'If one person is in the yoga path and the partner is a Sufi or Buddhist, is there a way to support each other or are there inherent difficulties in such a situation?','Different spiritual path is not a factor. Different mind to relate to each other is a factor. We are all different even if we have the same path. But we still relate to each other with a spirit of compromise. When this spirit of compromise doesn&#039;t exist, there is always contradiction and confrontation even though we have the same path.'),(11,19,'In one sense we are supposed to forget about and let go of the mind-body complex but these practices bring us back to focus on the mind and body.','How we are forgetting mind-body complex? We function with the mind-body complex.

Purity of thought and silence is focus on the mind. Is this focus on the mind and body used as a way to get beyond the mind and body?','All these practices are for weakening the egocentric desires.

So many things we don&#039;t need to experience because we know they are not conducive to our self-development. Some experiences we go through and as a result we get trapped by bhoga or pleasure and pain. This is our prison. When we are in prison and see the prison walls and feel choked inside, then we think to get out (apavarga). So we create good behavior and prison authorities start liking us and in time we get out.'),(14,19,'I understand that through sadhana, the ego purifies and there&#039;s a natural tendency to become less attached to the fruits of action.

Others practice the rules of restraints and observances, regular practice of meditation, etc.'),(16,19,'About mental action and physical action: can mental action create physical action and vice versa?','In common people, yes. Like object creates desire and desire manifests the object. But for the yogi who is completely desireless, this doesn&#039;t happen. A common person picks an apple and sees it. He sees it, he eats it, and he appreciates it. The yogi does the same thing but there is a difference. The yogi doesn&#039;t carry the memory. It doesn&#039;t create any attachment or addiction.'),(17,19,'When we become aware of our desires during meditation, such as thoughts of our investments in the stock market, or going to the bakery, what do we do?','All desires are present all the time, but the mind is so busy with various things that we don&#039;t notice it. During meditation, we separate ourselves from the outer world; the mind slows down. Now the inner thoughts have the full freedom to appear. How to remove it? Keeping the mind in one object. The mind goes out repeatedly but bring it back whenever it sneaks out. Don&#039;t be discouraged or frustrated. Keep the mind alert and aware of its nature of sneaking out. Gradually the concentration will get stronger and sneaking out mind will get weaker.'),(18,19,'It seems there is spiritual perfection and there is spiritual progress. We tend to be hard on ourselves if we feel we&#039;re not attaining spiritual perfection. On the path, it&#039;s easy to lose track of perfection and progress and hard to understand the difference between the two.','There is always progress. If you go hiking, you cover some distance. You may not cover the distance you choose, but there is progress. Understanding a little truth in life is a big progress. &quot;I am angry; I hate it.&quot; This knowing is a big progress. Spiritual perfection is a big word. It cannot be defined completely by any language since God is infinite and the striver to achieve God will understand God principle according to one&#039;s finite mind. Spiritual perfection is knowing God principle within but it is not complete. The ultimate perfection is merging in God principle where duality doesn&#039;t exist.'),(1,20,'The Gita speaks of lamenting for our loved ones. I have a loved one who committed murder and is in prison. Is it wrong to feel compassion for such a person?','Arjuna represents the ego of individuality. Arjuna was fighting to liberate himself from all attachments. But in the battlefield, he started lamenting for those who were killed and those who would get killed.

It&#039;s only our ego&#039;s expression.'),(2,20,'Aren&#039;t those for whom he was lamenting actually the negative qualities within himself which he was reluctant to destroy?','Symbolically, yes. But negative qualities and positive qualities both are in the mind. And you can&#039;t tell when some quality becomes negative. Attachment is not negative in a common person.

It takes much inner strength to change oneself.'),(5,20,'It seems very difficult to break through the addiction to negative relations.','Yes, it&#039;s very, very, very difficult. And also very easy! When the mind understands itself truthfully, then it&#039;s easy. Think of any situation and find out your mind&#039;s desire involved in it. In a relationship, for example, you have fixed desire and expectation. When it&#039;s not fulfilled exactly as you want, the confrontations start. Your ego doesn&#039;t want to compromise because compromise for the ego is like losing the battle.

Anything can work.'),(7,20,'Sometimes when the desire is very strong for the negative feeling to go away, it seems to strengthen the negativity.','Do you know the ego feels its existence in negativity and in positivity the ego doesn&#039;t feel so strongly?

Why are we afraid? If you are in the woods all alone and a person comes running towards you, your first thought will be that is a bad person coming to hurt me.&quot; The person comes and asks if that path goes to a village. Then you feel better and think the person is not bad. Do you see how fast the ego is ready to defend itself? In a community, there is so much comparison with others.

What is the mechanism of that?','If you reflect on your past, you will notice that all bad things that happened to you appear as if they happened yesterday and the memory of good things appear as if in a fog. Our ego feels its presence more deeply in pain or in pain-causing events, thoughts, emotions. So we always think about such things which bring unhappiness. In that unhappiness, we feel &quot;it&#039;s happening to me,&quot; even though it happened 10-20 years ago. So pain and suffering are the expression of the ego caused by desires and attachments.'),(2,21,'We get so busy in our lives and identify with the body-mind complex. What can we do to see the mind and body as two separate principles?','Body is an instrument for the mind to function and create ignorance. In that state of ignorance we strive for worldly happiness, success, etc. so it&#039;s real to us. If we say it&#039;s all nothing and sit aside doing nothing, then we end up living in more pain. When the mind starts seeing the pain and its cause, desires, then the mind starts separating its attachment to objects. This nonattachment is not physical but the mind starts seeing there is no actual value in worldly things. If gold is not used as a precious metal in the world, no one will pick up gold lying on the ground. We gave values and we can devalue them. Mind and body are two separate principles but they work together and enable us to function in the world. They function not due to their own power but there is a power of the self-reflecting in mind-body complex. But in a state of ignorance the power of the self is not identified and mind-body complex becomes the knower, perceiver, performer, etc.'),(3,21,'Recently my dad died and it gave my mind a lot of pain. I have other people in my life who I am actually attached to. How do we devalue? Intellectually I realize that. How do I take it to a deeper step?','It&#039;s quite natural for you to feel pain when your dad died. Children are attached to their parents and parents are attached to their children. This attachment is a rope which ties down people they love. If you reflect on this attachment, you will find that it is a mental conditioning. Because you have established a relationship with them as &quot;my -----&quot;, so our ego expects them to live forever. But if we reflect on truth then we will find that no one is immortal. We can prove it because there is no one alive from past 1000 years. So we have to accept the truth that anyone who takes birth has an end.'),(4,21,'It seems we have to go through this pain in order to come to liberation.','Pain reminds us of our goal of achieving liberation. No one wants to live in pain. We are born with some divine knowledge. These are the four situations which make a person to seek for liberation. Buddha was a prince. Everything was available to him.

Is that a form of violence?','There are so many violent games. Why children throw rocks on a frog pond? The frogs are not harming anyone. You see violence is in human nature. That&#039;s why first comes nonviolence in the five rules of yamas. If you think of opposites of these five rules of yamas, you will find the opposite of yama and niyama support our egocentric existence. We want to feel our existence and we feel it in violence, pain, miseries, selfishness, etc. If in doing good things, we don&#039;t feel pride, name and fame, then only that selfless action reduces egocentric desires. We do good things and also want everybody should know about it. In such good work with self-interest, we are not releasing ourselves from the trap of ignorance. Children will play violent games as long as they don&#039;t understand what violence is and how it is harming our mind by creating violent memories.'),(7,21,'I am wondering about the goal of life and liberation.','What is life? Life is our feeling of I-amness. What does it do? It creates an illusory world for its self-interest. That brings pain and miseries. That state of mind brings the idea of getting liberation.

So the purpose of human life is 1) experience which is natural, 2) getting liberation from all experience which we have to attain by purifying our mind by living a virtuous life.'),(8,21,'In the unfolding of the divine plan, even though there is more attachment, is it creating the ability for the knower to know itself? Is there a divine plan?','Prakriti exists for the Purusha to be known by itself. Prakriti is for experience and that experience creates pleasure, pain, attachment. When the mind starts seeing the cause of pain, then it starts withdrawing from all pain-causing things. Divine plan is experience and get liberation from all the experienced memories. We are nothing but our memories. We don&#039;t know the future and the present is only a moment, so we are living in our past memories. It&#039;s hard. But real. Watch your mind and you will notice the past is chasing you all the time and everywhere. The knower is the conscious principle. It doesn&#039;t need to know itself because it is only conscious principle inside out. The embodied self which is rooted in the mind acts like the mind. That self needs to achieve liberation from the mental experiences.'),(9,21,'On the road to dispassion, is the realization that we have to remove all the pain, and that pleasure is pain, is that what is causing the pain? If you realize that you&#039;re trying to get liberation through dispassion and know that you have to let go of all this, does that cause the pain?','If all the memories are totally forgotten, then you are liberated right there. Nirvana is a term for liberation. Nir = without; vana = arrow, or pain causing. Freedom from pain is nirvana. Attachment is that shackle which binds a being into ignorance. Dispassion is that force which breaks the shackle into pieces and liberates the soul.'),(1,22,'If we know we are doing our duty with attachment, is it enough just to be aware of it?','In the beginning, duty is done with attachment, because there is a desire to get something back. By sticking to one&#039;s duty, the mind starts loosening one&#039;s self interest. In performing duty, there will be an austerity if the attachment and self-interest are watched and effort is made to remove them.'),(2,22,'The idea of dharma or duty expresses the relationship of subject and object between the person and everything around him. That&#039;s the stuff of our attachment.','Attachment is an expression of the ego. In all identifications the ego is expressing its presence in a form of desire and attachment.'),(3,22,'So our whole relationship with things that determine our dharma is an expression of our dharma, which is attachment. So we are responding to the situation in doing our duty, which was created by our attachments.','Yes. We cannot start from the top. If we were already nonattached, then there is no need of anything. In all of our activities there is attachment and likes and dislikes. But when the Dharma becomes our aim, then the ego, attachment and desires start loosening their grip.'),(4,22,'I am curious about the process of doing your duty that causes us to gradually lose self-interest. How is self-interest reduced?','In doing the duty there is austerity. The mind is not considering self-interest as a prime object, but the Duty or Dharma is the main aim.'),(5,22,'Even when no rewards, no fun, etc.?','You do your duty no matter what. There is a story about two Allahabad University students. One was a Shiva devotee and one was atheist. This Shiva devotee would cross the Ganga and there was a Shiva temple on the other side. He would worship and swim back. The atheist would also go to swim and go to the other side of the river and sit outside the temple without any devotion and worship. It was a good exercise for him. In the monsoon season, the river floods for miles. One time in the monsoon season, when the river had a heavy flood, the devotee saw the river like an ocean. He bowed from that place and went home. The atheist also went and saw the flooding river. He began to think that if I didn&#039;t go to the other side, then the daily routine would be broken.&quot; He waited there for some time and saw a drifting log. He jumped in the river and caught the drifting log. He tried to row the log but failed. So he jumped in the river and started swimming. He swam with his full energy and finally crossed the river, but 4-5 miles down from the temple. He walked to the temple and sat on his usual place. He was tired but his mind was thinking about the Shiva. He thought his friend did not worship the Shiva, so his mind started dwelling on the Shiva and got deep into samadhi. He stayed there for several days. The flood also went away. And then he came back to the University campus, but a different person. The duty which was an austerity and sacrifice brought calmness in his mind.'),(6,22,'But the Gita also says it&#039;s better to do your own duty imperfectly rather than another&#039;s duty perfectly.','He did his own duty. It is what he was doing every day. He did not stop it out of fear of flood.'),(7,22,'How does duty relate to discipline? We talk about having a discipline and sticking to it, and having a duty.','Duty is a discipline. Without discipline one cannot perform ones duty.'),(8,22,'In that story, he had no aim but self-interest.','Duty was his aim. He did not swim for money or name or fame. He was not competing with anyone.'),(9,22,'He just had a discipline. He didn&#039;t have a duty. He wasn&#039;t performing a service.','He fulfilled his self chosen duty at the risk of his own life. Determination.'),(10,22,'If you are not determined, you won&#039;t go anywhere. It is right.','Yes, but it came from an ego place.'),(11,22,'Without the ego, no discipline, no austerity, no determination is possible. The ego which traps in the world should be weakened and not that ego which is conducive to liberation. In showing devotion to the self-chosen duty, due to that determination, when he started to dwell on Shiva, he got samadhi very fast.','He took such a big risk. He got very tired. When he sat as usual, he thought of his friend&#039;s cause. A person with such strong determination will change.'),(12,22,'It seems that all duty and discipline are with self-interest. If studiously and consistently practiced, that in itself produces a favorable result?','Yes, because of austerity in performing it.'),(13,22,'The implication is that duty has to be an austerity. Can&#039;t you enjoy your duty as well? Yes. Sometimes enjoyable and sometimes many difficulties. They both enjoyed swimming in the river.','At times when one starts out with austerity, later one can take great pleasure in having succeeded in doing ones duty well.'),(14,22,'Yes. Then what happens?','Sticking to duty in all conditions. This kind of discipline is created in the mind.'),(15,22,'So you are placing duty at a very high level.','Yes, one time I was with Neem Karoli Baba in Haldwani. It was snowy in Nainital. He told me he wants to see a man in Bhowali and can&#039;t go there. I said, &quot;I will go and bring the man.&quot; I took a car and went to Bhowali. The snow was 3 feet deep and the car could not go. The driver said, &quot;You go; I am going home.&quot; I had only one cloth and no shoes. I walked 5-6 miles in that snow. When I went to his house, he had already left. Then I walked back. I took it as my duty.'),(16,22,'In the story about the Allahabad students, one student was strong in self-interest, but in your story, service was at the core.','Duty was in both. The student has self-interest, but the duty became first priority in his mind.'),(17,22,'When you were walking in the snow that night, it must have been brutally cold and there must have been deep pain in the body.','Snow burns the skin. Feet become numb. Those who don&#039;t wear shoes, they can tolerate cold more.'),(18,22,'With that type of pain, how did you, and how can we, keep the mind steady?','Pain is not felt when one is performing duty. Those who climb mountains, their pain becomes secondary and the aim comes first.'),(19,22,'Doesn&#039;t the motivation have to be incredibly intense?','Yes, without strong motivation nothing can be achieved.'),(20,22,'Is duty a beginning stage where we respond to our circumstances and try to stick with it, and sacrifice is a higher level where we are operating not out of self-interest and doing our duty for creation?','Duty with self-interest; duty without self-interest. A policeman goes to the night duty because he is paid for it. In his duty, he also takes risks. But he gets paid for it.'),(21,22,'It seems there is a difference between the realized being who is operating just with prarabdha karma. Is that being still performing duty? Would their actions also be called duty?','That is not self-chosen duty. It is a nature-born duty. It is like the sun is giving heat and light day in and day out.'),(22,22,'So Self-dedicated means dedicated to God?','Yes.'),(23,22,'Last night you said, in devotional yoga, &quot;God incarnates and does everything and then disappears.&quot;','Like Krishna incarnates and disappears to the devotees of Krishna. Whatever they achieve, they say it&#039;s a gift from God.'),(1,23,'Could you share your personal feeling about God?','God is the eternal peace. In that peace, everything shines out in its reality. No illusion. Everyone feels peace some time. When that peace deepens, that brings divine light in a person.'),(2,23,'How is that different from maya, the apparent unreality?','Maya is also eternal. It is a creative energy of God. Maya creates an illusion and then it is gone. A post in a dark night appears as a ghost. The ghost was never there in reality, but the appearance is real. In eternal peace, when the mind is enlightened by divine knowledge, there is neither the post nor the ghost.'),(3,23,'What does peace actually feel like? Is it like tranquillity or calmness, or nonattachment to our own emotions so that we can feel them but we don&#039;t own them?','Peace is a state of the mind free from all desires. Its also called supremely contented. Still these are words. Reality is your own experience.'),(4,23,'You said that peace is a state of the mind free from all desires. Do you no longer have the desires or just are not attached to the desire?','We have desires; that is why we are restless. Desires are the expression of individualized ego. When that ego subsides, then everything is universal. Universal desire. Attachment brings reality in all desires. Desires without attachment is a tasteless food.'),(5,23,'So in a state of peace, there is no desire?','No desire means no individualized ego who desires.'),(6,23,'How are happiness and peace related? Is peace the only real happiness?','When happiness moves beyond the mind, that is peace.'),(7,23,'What does happiness beyond the mind mean?','The mind is constituted by the three gunas: 1) consciousness, 2) passion, 3) inertia. Any kind of feeling that arises in the mind is a product of the three gunas. Supreme peace or happiness is not caused by the gunas. It&#039;s a state in which divine presence shines.'),(8,23,'Sometimes I feel close to God during meditation and have a peaceful day. Sometimes I get angry and then I feel distant from God. What can be done?','When the mind is in sattva guna (pure state), then there is peace and the mind goes toward God. When rajas guna (passionate state) predominates, passion increases and anger develops. Gunas are always changing. The change of gunas changes the human thoughts. It has a productivity also. Without this change there can&#039;t be any productivity. This change makes a person to function and produces new things. But for ones self-development, sattvic nature (pure state) is needed.'),(9,23,'If peace is our natural state, why is it so difficult for us to control the mind and stop our thoughts?','Because the ego is always looking out to get something for its comfort, enjoyment and for its defense.'),(10,23,'I am impressed with the concept that peace begins with me, but what about keeping a balance with social action?','When peace gets rooted within, it spreads out in selfless action. In selfish action, the peace is disturbed.'),(11,23,'So peace would lead us to selfless action?','It will happen naturally because in a peaceful state the ego stops hankering and the mind will function selflessly. To take action to help others with no self-interest brings a greater sense of peace. That creates a desire for more peace.'),(12,23,'Is it okay to focus on that peace?','Yes. What is the cause of that peace? Reduction of self-interest removes restlessness of the mind. Restlessness is the nature of our ego.'),(13,23,'When I am sitting here with Babaji, I feel very peaceful, but when its time to sit for meditation, then peace is gone. What causes that? Is the desire for peace so strong that it blocks my experiencing it?','The mind is distracted by thoughts from going in, so in that state, when the mind is not identified with the past memories and future hopes, instead the mind feels peace. But that peace is only momentary like a graveyard dispassion. In meditation, the mind is going in and seeing all kinds of restlessness caused by desires, and the mind is feeling distracted rather than peaceful. But in reality, in meditation you are finding out what is buried there and you can dig them out.'),(14,23,'You have said that the highest sense of duty is to get peace. Sri Krishna was advising Arjuna to fight and kill his relatives. That doesn&#039;t sound like a way to gain peace.','1) Arjuna was a prince. 2) Symbolically the jiva. As a prince it was his duty to remove bad elements who were disturbing peace in the kingdom. So Krishna was right to tell him to fight. As a jiva, we have to fight with our negative thoughts in order to attain peace.'),(15,23,'I feel a desire for peace but sometimes I forget. When I come into Babajis presence, then I remember but it develops more attachment. Is that a positive thing?','A guru, a deity, a teaching can be the reminder of our aim. But the main thing is to take our own responsibility to achieve peace. We can still use external instruments to help us to attain peace.'),(16,23,'Looking at history it seems that humans have been out of balance many, many times. Do you see us going into a darker or a lighter time right now?','Can you tell if any country is in total peace? So the whole world is in turmoil. It&#039;s making those samskaras. If somehow people switch their minds and make peace with everyone, only then the lighter period can start. If you are alone sitting somewhere, a man runs towards you. The first thought will be he may attack me; he is a bad man. That is the way we have fear of each other.'),(17,23,'When I am outside in nature, I feel more in tune with myself and more at peace and connected to God. Is that state conducive to achieving peace?','In nature all things are working in their pure state. There is no egoism involved. So anyone who is surrounded by natural beauty, if that person&#039;s mind is not restless, will attain peace.'),(18,23,'When you realize God, how do you know that it&#039;s not a delusion or a self-creation of the mind?','God realization means:   all worldly desires subside,  the mind dwells in eternal peace,  the mind doesn&#039;t get confused by illusory reality. '),(19,23,'How can we tell if we are making real progress on our spiritual path?','Progress is seen:   the mind gets less attached to the world,  desire to obtain and hoard things gets weak,  the mind gets more peaceful. '),(20,23,'You have said that when you meditate three things can happen: serenity, purity, clarity. What is the expression of purity?','Peace is the expression of all three.'),(1,24,'Please comment on maintaining the practice of awareness.','Being aware of every event as a witness and not getting involved in it. If you are hungry you eat. But your action will be without awareness because that&#039;s the way the mind is set. When you are aware of that thought and action, then you are in the present. Keeping the mind in the present or being aware is the same thing.'),(2,24,'Keeping the mind in the present doesn&#039;t guarantee samadhi does it?','Yes. It is only in words &quot;I am aware,&quot; but it should be experienced &#039;I am&#039;, which is indicating your true Self should be in the present.'),(3,24,'What do you mean?','To be aware of thoughts and actions.'),(4,24,'About the example of food and hunger.','Thought comes first, then action.'),(5,24,'How to keep awareness of the present in that example?','I am feeling hungry. I am eating. You keep your awareness in eating. It is not done mechanically. We do things mechanically. Our minds are so trained in doing things that we are not aware of it. An example is bicycle riding. We don&#039;t even think we are bicycle riding. Bicycle gets lost in our mind. Riding gets lost. The only thing the mind remembers is where I should go.'),(6,24,'Lots of things I do that way, out of boredom, wasting my time thinking about them.','It is boring; that&#039;s why it&#039;s a yoga practice.'),(7,24,'Suppose when I&#039;m sitting in the present moment and my mind goes to my house where I forgot to do something.','The memory of the past always comes. Even in those thoughts one should remain present. Awareness of the thoughts.'),(8,24,'What about doing japa while doing those things?','That is awareness in the divine presence.'),(9,24,'Japa also becomes mechanical.','Yes, it becomes mechanical, but there is background awareness which is still good.'),(10,24,'How is keeping the mind in the present applied to meditation?','1) Keeping the mind in the present is one kind of meditation. The mind goes out but you are always with it. 2) To concentrate on one object and merging in that is the other method.'),(1,25,'What kind of duties are good for youth to bring to community?','Duty itself is a great quality. We are responsible for the family, friends, community, and country. In a community we have to think about the whole community first. Any duty which is given to individuals should be done honestly and enthusiastically. Duties can be any but motive behind the duty should be &quot;to serve.&quot;'),(2,25,'The spiritual path is a positive one but may also be used to hide behind or blind development. How can one recognize when this happens and prevent it?','That is why reflection is important. Mostly people hide by creating a false belief. One should use pure intellect to find out the truthfulness of the path they follow. Spiritual path is like climbing up the mountain. One can fall by creating false beliefs.'),(3,25,'Reflect upon what you learn or remember?','That, too. Listening, Reflection, Concentration go together. We don&#039;t listen. We hear the sound and by reflex action we answer it. Nothing penetrates deep in the mind up to the heart. You can reflect upon what you honestly listen.'),(4,25,'If there is a difficult decision in life to make, how does one do so with reflection? Is it any different with worldly aims?','The rules are the same. Ego, attachment, desire is our life. When we use those energies for the world, we feel pleasure or pain. When we use those same energies for self development, we feel peace. For worldly aims in which ego, attachment and desires are the prime energies, we cannot reflect honestly as long as we don&#039;t make our mind stable. Stable mind is capable to find out the reality of anything.'),(5,25,'Can one understand spirituality intellectually without practicing?','Spirituality means leading a virtuous life. It doesn&#039;t mean you have to accept God or worship a deity. An atheist can be spiritual. Practice is needed to make the mind placid and virtuous. But if a person has accepted virtuous life with no resistance of the ego, then no physical practices are needed.'),(6,25,'How do we cultivate faith and eliminate doubt?','Faith develops by experience. Doubt comes by not knowing. As long as truth is not experienced one can pretend faith and in that kind of faith, doubt will arise. But one who has experienced the truth, then question of doubt doesn&#039;t arise.'),(7,25,'Why do doubts come if the aim is God?','God is unknown, unseen, unexperienced, so doubts always come. When I was young, a 90-year-old sadhu came to my ashram. I asked him if all his doubts are resolved. He said, &quot;right now, I will say yes. Next moment, I may doubt.&quot;'),(8,25,'How does one develop confidence without playing into the ego?','We feel doubts because we don&#039;t know how it will come out. We cannot do anything without ego&#039;s involvement. Confidence is an expression of the ego. Losing confidence is also an expression of the ego. If the mind is strengthened by doing positive things it develops confidence in the ego.'),(9,25,'Often I place myself above or below others. How do I remain equal?','When you see fear in front of someone you put yourself below. When you are not afraid of someone you put yourself above. For example, you are sitting on a beach by yourself and a man comes towards you walking fast. Your first thought will be &quot;he may hurt me.&quot; If a young boy comes toward you, you will not think that way. In the first case you put yourself below in strength and in the second case you put yourself higher in strength. Human mind always compares oneself in all situations.'),(10,25,'Is fear from lack of knowledge or misunderstanding?','Ignorance is cause of fear, not knowing. Misunderstanding is also ignorance.'),(11,25,'I have had anger inside for years but I don&#039;t want it anymore. How do I get rid of it?','Anger and fear are two sides of the same coin. You are afraid so you use anger as defense mechanism. If you remove your fear, then anger will subside.'),(12,25,'How is fear removed?','Face, Fight, Finish. When we don&#039;t face it, we magnify it. We hide from our own self-created ghost.'),(13,25,'What if you can&#039;t see it clearly?','Mental perception should be clear to see the self-created ghost. As long as the mind is possessed by selfishness, its perception will be deluded by anger, fear, greed, etc.'),(14,25,'What is liberation?','We have conditioned our mind that we are in bondage. So all our actions, thoughts, and feelings are only binding. When the mind is conditioned to think &quot;I am not liberated,&quot; and if we simply say &quot;I am liberated&quot; that will not uncondition our mind. 1) Spiritual practice, 2) reflection, 3) meditation removes all mental conditionings which are coming from our past lives and also those we developed in the present life. A mind free from all conditionings is liberation.'),(15,25,'Is there a point where poverty affects our path towards liberation?','Who tries for liberation? 1) One who is in pain, 2) one who seeks to power, 3) one who is curious to know higher power, 4) one who has wisdom. Buddha felt pain. He was a prince. Everything was available. But he was poor. Worldly wealth was nothing for him. So he left his wife and son and started wandering. Poverty can affect the path either in a positive way or in a negative way. A person can develop dispassion for the world or a person may become a thief.'),(16,25,'We learn about many paths. How do we find ours, by experience or reflection?','The main path is to live a virtuous life. When the mind is set on this path, then it finds one particular path. Without reflection we can&#039;t see the real path.'),(17,25,'What virtues should we develop?','Honesty, truthfulness, love, compassion, non-violence, etc.'),(18,25,'How do desires and memory relate when someone dreams of an event and it comes true?','Desire = present, imagination = future, memory = past. The mind knows but it is veiled by worldly thoughts. In dream the mind is only in the dream. In awakened state the mind is scattered everywhere. In a desire if the mind is scattered then you can&#039;t dream. When the mind is in one object, it knows more about it. Sometimes in a dream when the mind is in a pure state, it sees the future.'),(19,25,'What if we see suffering but cannot help?','Sufferings are always in life. We learn from suffering. We are limited in our powers. Anything that is beyond our powers, we become helpless. If something is within our power and capability we should try to help.'),(1,26,'What is the balance between avoiding negative emotions like anger or confronting and examining it?','If you just avoid it, then it will not be worked out. If you avoid it by understanding the cause, then it will work out. If you express it honestly, that will lead to more confrontation. Or it may work out if the other person sees the cause. What causes it? The cause is not outside. It is within us and we don&#039;t want to accept &quot;it&#039;s me.&quot;'),(2,26,'Is there a point where I would avoid seeing negativity in other people and not have contact with that or better to confront it?','Not to take it in. You see a gambler. You say it&#039;s a negative thing. You can&#039;t avoid the person. You need only to avoid that desire. First confront the negativities within. Then you can honestly see the negativity in others.'),(3,26,'Suppose I&#039;m at my job and someone criticizes and I respond by saying it was right. How do I keep my image of being productive and competent and still weaken my ego of individuality which is important for my sadhana?','If you are right and you know you are right, then don&#039;t dwell in criticism. By arguing you want to prove it is right, when it is already right. If someone tells a 6- foot tall man, &quot;you are not really 6 feet tall,&quot; then what will he say? We like to do these things because it feeds our negative part of life.'),(4,26,'If liking to tell stories of painful and tragic experiences we&#039;ve had keeps our ego alive, what about liking to tell stories of devotional experiences we&#039;ve had? Are we still just keeping our ego alive?','Ego gets its strength as individuality in negative thoughts. In positive thoughts, the ego becomes sattvic (pure). Ego still exists.'),(5,26,'Most everyone at some point experiences extreme anger or rage. What is the best way to release that anger or rage?','Anger is in the human nature. In this creation, humans are on the highest level and yet the most cruel creatures. No animal harms anyone with no reason except humans. We express this violence all the time in various ways. We are used to it so we don&#039;t notice it. If we learn to watch the cause of our action, then we start noticing it. In extreme rage, people lose their discrimination and become violent physically or verbally. One should learn to think before acting.'),(6,26,'So the best way to deal with anger is to notice the cause?','Yes, but that does not develop until the mind is pure. To purify the mind, a disciplined and virtuous life is important.'),(7,26,'Is it possible to turn the mind toward positive energy and not have to find the cause, or is it necessary to root out the real cause?','When the anger is buried down by positive life, in time it will become dormant. Why do we get angry? We defend our existence. We don&#039;t just exist; we exist with lots of desires. If any desire is obstructed, we burst with anger. So the root is not very far to dig. Just watch the rising desires and treat them as binding thoughts.'),(8,26,'You&#039;ve said that as we do virtuous things regularly, it becomes a pattern. We can do good things often and then in a moment of anger or frustration, an act comes out and it hurts someone. That seems to stick in our mind more strongly than the good things we are doing.','1) Good things create good samskaras. 2) Bad things create bad samskaras. In good things, the ego doesn&#039;t feel its strength of individuality as strongly as in doing bad things. If you do bad things, the ego is right there in the present. Then its memory which repeats in the past. Then its imagination of doing bad things in the future appears. If we look back in our own life, what do we remember the most? All bad things we did or people did to us. Memories of good things appear as if veiled by fog.'),(9,26,'The Gita talks about not reacting to people with cruel and abusive, harsh speech. How to create the equanimity of mind not to react?','Very, very, very hard. But not impossible. You try your best. In the process of trying, you start understanding what causes that reaction. The more you understand this cause, the less you react.'),(10,26,'In the Gita it says to speak truthfully, to relate what we have seen, heard and experienced. Because everyone is governed by his or her egos, it&#039;s impossible. For example, after World War II, growing up in Austria, people would not speak of what had been done to Jews, gypsies, or homosexuals. In India, the same is true with people of lower caste. It&#039;s easy to see what is happening when you come from outside. But those involved are not seeing, hearing or experiencing it.','You know the cause: how our ego wants its power in all situations. This is a universal thing. All common people live this way. No country is better. The Gita is talking about those who are seeking liberation. But we forget the teachings and start thinking what is good for us. Then we defend our way of living in the world. The problem did not change after Germany up to this day. It will always exist if everyone doesn&#039;t understand the cause. What happened in Germany was never forgotten in the mind of sufferers but those people became numb and powerless.'),(11,26,'Sometimes we do things we feel we need to do for our own benefit and the result is that people are hurt, for example leaving a dysfunctional family. How do we discriminate or justify or how does it fit in with non-harming?','We always need to stand up for our own progress. Our self-development is the most important part of this life. But in this process, we cannot separate our family, friends, teachers and others. They also help us either by doing good or bad things. Life is for learning. We learn by experiencing good or bad things.'),(12,26,'Yesterday, when a 7-8 year old boy asked &quot;how come you know so much?&quot; you said to &quot;listen to your parents and teachers.&quot; Does that still apply when the boy is 14-16 years old?','Did you ever notice how much we listen? If an astrologer says you will live to be 60 years of age, you will always remember it because you listened to it with elephant ears. So what we listen to we remember. Listening is the most important thing for one&#039;s self-development. If we listen honestly, then we can reflect on it. Then only our intellect can discriminate right or wrong.'),(13,26,'Sometimes in speaking the truth, the words aren&#039;t pleasant and are offensive. Is it better to speak the truth of a situation or to avoid speaking anything that may be taken to be offensive?','It depends how the person uses words in speaking the truth. If the person acts superior and says something: &quot;this is wrong; it should be like this.&quot; You spoke straight but forgot about your ego that is putting itself in a superior position. If you tell the truth in more compromising language, then it will not hurt the feelings of the other person.'),(14,26,'If we see two people in a conversation and someone is getting hurt, as a third party, how can one decide whether to get involved to help the situation?','If you know them, then you can do that. If you do it to unknown people, they both will attack you because you are trying to poke your nose in someone else&#039;s affairs. You can ask them about giving your suggestions.'),(15,26,'What is the best practice for controlling a critical mind and a critical tongue?','The tongue is easy to control, but the mind is hard to control. Why is one critical of others? It is our own fear. We are defending ourselves by attacking others. Offensive defense. You hit before one tries to hit you. The tongue doesn&#039;t function independently. The critical mind expresses itself by critical words.'),(1,27,'How do you reach a state of remembering God constantly where we don&#039;t forget about God all day and night?','First it needs a regular practice to think of God in all meditational and physical activities before we start. Then it becomes a habit. We remember God even in changing postures, in opening the door, in walking out of the door and stepping into the car. God&#039;s name is used as a mantra.'),(2,27,'What does it mean to think of God? What do you think of?','God has no name and no form, devoid of qualities. We can only define God in terms of universal truth. But that God is no help to us in remembering. So we create our God as a support which has father-like support, mother-like love, who will listen to our prayers. It&#039;s our creation but it gives us support.'),(3,27,'Is it not real? Is it self-created?','If a person marries a woman, what makes that person that man&#039;s wife? Isn&#039;t it a self-created relationship but it feels real?'),(4,27,'If you haven&#039;t had a loving mother or a supportive father, how do you create a God in that image as a support?','You did not have such a relationship with your parents, but you have seen it in other families and you have read stories also. What we experience or we understand, we can bring it back in our memory. If we say God has no name, no form, or no qualities, and is actionless, etc., then it sounds like nothing and nothing can&#039;t do anything to us. But we want a support. We don&#039;t want to scare ourselves or feel supportless or always alone.'),(5,27,'But in reality, we are always alone and without support.','If we understand &quot;I am,&quot; we are in reality. Then we don&#039;t need a support. Because we understand it wrong, then we create a support. In understanding, we use a wrong idea that &quot;I am&quot; this mind-body complex. We don&#039;t see that all-pervasive divine spark within and without, so we need a support due to our ignorance.'),(6,27,'What is the correct understanding of &quot;I am?&quot;','The &quot;I am&quot; term indicates my relation to the outer world. As long as this outer relationship exists, we think this body, living in this world, attached to others, is &quot;I am.&quot; If we reflect more honestly, we will find this &quot;I am&quot; is only the world involvement. Get divorced from this relationship and what is left is &quot;I am,&quot; and that &quot;I am&quot; is universal &quot;I am&quot; or divine consciousness.'),(7,27,'Because my creation of God and its support is self-created, it can&#039;t be stronger than my own person. When I fall back, then this self-created God falls as well. How can that be helpful?','All relationships are self-created. We create a reality in those relationships. Like a wife, husband, our house, owner of the house, etc. We cannot say &quot;this is not my husband&quot; after marriage or &quot;this is not my house&quot; after buying it. This false relationship is real until something appears and we separate from it. The notion of God exists strongly because our mind is conditioned this way since humans started that idea of God. So it will not fall apart so easily. You can see it in Russia. Even after so many years of communism, they did not forget about God. As soon as communism rule was removed, people started talking about God openly.'),(8,27,'When one reflects deeply, one concludes that we cannot worship God as infinite with the finite mind. Is worship of God in all worship, regardless of form?','The infinite, if understood, will be finite, because the understanding mechanic mind is finite. The finite cannot describe the infinite. So understanding means describing. We can describe only in terms of finite. All forms indicate the same divine potency. The sound of A in different languages has different form of alphabet, but all the different forms of alphabet sound is A.'),(9,27,'You have written that &quot;God is love.&quot; How can I generate more love in myself? When I feel fear or other negative qualities, I feel I can rid myself of them if I could generate more love.','Love is a state of mind where self-interests are removed. The mind dwells in its natural state of sat-chit-ananda - existence, consciousness, bliss. Love is not created; it is a mental state which develops by living a disciplined life and developing positive qualities.'),(10,27,'The selfless divine love that develops in a person, is it love for God or love for humanity? If love for humanity, does that person love different people differently?','Love for humanity is not different from love for God. If humanity was created by humans in the first place, then it would be different. If the divine presence is in every being, then in all these different forms we are loving God. Loving a dog, loving wife, loving one&#039;s own children, etc.: the way of loving is different but the love is the same for that selfless person.'),(11,27,'I have heard that the purpose of life is to please God. Do you agree or disagree with that?','100%, but how? How do you please an unseen, unknown? Purpose of human incarnation is to experience the world and get liberation. Pleasing God means working for one&#039;s self liberation all the time.'),(12,27,'You do nothing.','Then we lose purpose of human life. God is a term created by our mind. We create the word or name so we give form to God and try our best to do good things, to live a virtuous life, to try to please that God. We sing, chant, pray, help others, and do all other good things in the name of God. We go to church, temples, mosques. What happens there? It reminds us &quot;I want to please God.&quot; That reminding the mind in various ways purifies our mind.'),(1,28,'From your own experience, what would be the biggest obstacle to Self-realization?','Deluded mind. The mind which is colored by our ego, attachment and desire.'),(2,28,'So detachment is the hardest part for our Self-realization?','Yes, it&#039;s the hardest. The first step is removing attachment. The second step is it will weaken worldly desires. When attachment and desire are controlled, the ego will have no self-expression in the world. Without attachment, the desires become like insipid food. But you still eat it to live. How do we feel ourselves in the world? We are &quot;living.&quot; Because we have our needs, desires, expectations. We are attached to our family, friends and property. All these things feed the existence of our ego self. Then how to act in the world if the mind is not attached? A bank manager works hard knowing that the money in the bank is not his. If he is not on duty and thieves break into the bank, he doesn&#039;t feel sorrow. But on duty, he will not let anyone loot the bank.'),(3,28,'If we are trying to create nonattachment, is it better to forcibly restrain the desires? Or to watch the desires play out, see the pain they create and allow the attachments to die as we begin to see the insipidness of our desires?','Using force backfires. Understanding the attachment and how it creates pain and delusion works better. We see the insipidness of our desires only when the mind functions with an attitude of nonattachment. Pain is one of the causes which brings nonattachment or dispassion.'),(4,28,'So you want to be kind of neutral about things but still understand it, not indifferent? If we become detached, there&#039;s a problem of not caring.','Nonattached by understanding. If you understand the result of attachment, the mind develops nonattachment but it doesn&#039;t mean the duties are gone. You still live in a family, society and you associate with others in your jobs or businesses. You express your sympathy to the poor or those who are in pain. The only difference is your egocentric involvement.'),(5,28,'How can discernment and vairagya (detachment, dispassion) go together?','What is vairagya? Vi = without; raga = coloring, or without delusion. Dispassion develops when reality is known; then the mind gets detached to its unreal form.'),(6,28,'So you see the reality.','Yes. What does the surgeon do? The surgeon stands and works at surgery for 8-10 hours non-stop. He tries to do a good job but if the patient dies, he doesn&#039;t cry.'),(7,28,'If one is a householder, there needs to be a certain attachment to the world.','A lot! Two kinds of duty: with attachment and with nonattachment. In our worldly life, we have duties. We have to do everything as the society demands. We have to do it right but if we are acting with attachment but feeling nonattached, there is in reality nonattachment. Two people are in a fruit store. One is attached and one is nonattached. Both look at apples and pick which one is better. Both eat the apples. You will not notice which one is attached and which one is not. Attached person picks the apple, eats it, enjoys the taste and carries its memory. Nonattached person also eats it, enjoys it but doesn&#039;t carry the memory. So it&#039;s an experienced thing, not a matter that can be judged or tested.'),(8,28,'What does it look like for a bhakta or a jnani to be doing the same duties?','In activity, no difference. In feelings, there is. A devotional person is always surrendering to God. A jnani is always experiencing unreality in worldly things.'),(9,28,'What&#039;s the role of their own attitude and approach to the duty?','It&#039;s very hard to see the difference with physical eyes. With attachment and without attachment. There was a saint known as Kaushani Baba. He had a silver cup. He was using this cup to drink water. In traveling, his student was carrying it in his bag. In one place they stopped. They ate, and the cup was used. When they left, the student forgot to pack it. When Kaushani Baba knew his student forgot the cup, he created a big scene as if he will die without the cup. He was from a kingly family of Nepal. Money was no problem to him. He used to give away things all the time. Why did he do it? The student was a very forgetful man. To give him a teaching, he acted that way. Their attitude and approach to the duty is based on others benefit. They may act with compassion in one situation and in another situation they may act with toughness.'),(10,28,'What or how is the mind changed when knowledge is gained?','The mind sees things without desire and attachment. Human mind is colored by desire and attachment which colors the perception. If a person buys a new car and it gets dented, the owner feels a dent in the heart. Why? We don&#039;t feel it if someone else&#039;s new car is dented.'),(11,28,'I have heard a description of a saint taking a walk without thought, just being aware of what is around without thinking of it. It seems there was no object of concentration.','It means without attachment. If you stand by the highway, so many cars move. You see them and do not feel anything. When the mind is not pulled by the desire of multiple objects, then the mind is automatically in a concentrated state. Mind&#039;s restlessness subsides.'),(12,28,'The absolute is not separate from individuals but pervades the mind-body complex but it&#039;s not only that. There&#039;s a problem of misidentification of the forms of creation with the pure conscious principle, Self.','The &quot;I-amness&quot; which is rooted in the mind is ego self. Some saints who don&#039;t have the ego or &quot;I- amness,&quot; their mind-body still functions. So the ego which is only the notion of &quot;I-am&quot; becomes the owner of all the functions of mind-body complex. This ego self expresses itself by attachment and desire. The absolute is pure conscious principle. It pervades the whole creation. Without it, nothing can exist. The misidentification appears when the intellect starts thinking I-myself is consciousness, whereas the consciousness in the intellect is separate. It only pervades the intellect.'),(13,28,'In living our lives we feel and understand possessiveness and attachment, but it&#039;s hard to will that sense of possessiveness away. What do we do?','Who says it is easy? Philosophy doesn&#039;t work in practicality. A mother cannot remove her attachment to her baby. Her mind will never accept not to be attached to the baby. As long as the mind is not purified (i.e. rajas and tamas gunas are reduced), it is not possible. What do we do then? The answer is practice meditation on a regular basis which purifies the mind.'),(14,28,'How can I become more nonattached?','It&#039;s the hardest fight in human life. The Gita&#039;s teachings are based upon it. As long as we have the ego, we will have desires, attachment, needs, anger, fear, everything. This is our bondage in life, but we want to get out. So we have to strive for getting out. Where to start? Our bondage is caused by our mind and our liberation is also caused by the mind. So we have to purify the mind by spiritual practices. Spiritual practices means living a virtuous life. In Ashtanga Yoga, the yamas and niyamas (ten rules) are listed. In all religions there are rules included and all great people in the world advise us to live a virtuous life. So we have to trust their words and change our life for our own self-development.'),(1,29,'What do you mean by self-development?','Self-development means the ego self, which is always seeking the worldly pleasures (name, fame, and getting involved in negative ways of life), is turning to opposite direction. All positive qualities come in our self-development. All positive qualities weaken the ego and increase universal love. So any good quality cannot harm a person&#039;s self-development.'),(2,29,'It seems that the higher Self doesn&#039;t need to be developed because it is already perfect. In developing the lower self, how would that be different from developing the ego self?','Lower self is the ego self -&quot;I am this mind-body complex.&quot; When this notion of &quot;I am this mind- body complex&quot; changes to &quot;I am the Self,&quot; then the ego self merges in the higher Self.'),(3,29,'How is swabhava different from dharma?','Swabhava is one&#039;s own nature created by samskara. The dharma of human beings is to experience the world and to achieve liberation. Then according to swabhava, the person will be attracted to positive or negative experiences. We have a superior mind. We know what is good for our self-development and what is not.'),(4,29,'If you are performing action with no expectation of return for yourself, but we are still acting with some purpose. How do we know if it is a good purpose?','There is a purpose of self-development. If a person steals and says &quot;I am stealing for God, or for poor people&quot;, then it will not work. Because the person is stealing for his or her own desire which is not spiritual.'),(5,29,'If one is engaged in spiritual practice out of a sense of duty or a fear of criticism, and doesn&#039;t feel the desire to do the practice, should one continue to do the practice or not?','Faith is developed by practice. But doing it by outer pressure and not wanting it from inside is not right. Fear is always a cause of spiritual practice. We know our limitation and we have no cure for our pains, so we are pushed to believe that there is a superpower which can rescue us. Also experience and getting liberation is in human nature. For some reason, if a person is not pursuing his path of self-development now, later he or she will.'),(6,29,'How do we develop discrimination in daily life?','You have to see what helps in your self-development and what harms. If anything harms, that you have to reject. That rejection may harm worldly life, but will help spiritual life.'),(7,29,'Could you elaborate on the part about not reading inappropriate materials, that we should avoid reading books or having discussions which are contrary to our self- development?','Like violent stories create violent dreams. It proves that such things sink in the mind and fill the mind by its color.'),(8,29,'Could you elaborate on the rule about &quot;do not engage in unnecessary talks?&quot;','Unnecessary talks bring nothing positive. It may create some negativity. That negativity goes deep in the mind and creates negative nature. Also when we don&#039;t get any positive result then it is a waste of time.'),(9,29,'Could you elaborate on &quot;do not let laziness or dullness control your mind?&quot;','When laziness and dullness overpower the mind, we lose our discipline, our aim, and we just live in our own desires.'),(10,29,'When the mind gets dull, lethargy sets in, and you don&#039;t feel motivated to do sadhana, and you are barely able to gasp out a prayer, what do you recommend?','The only thing that works is &quot;kick yourself.&quot; It always works. No one wants to live a miserable life so we have to do something to get out of that mental bog. Even a little prayer will give energy to stand up and do something.'),(11,29,'You have said that our parents are the first gurus, and the scriptures tell us to obey our parents. If they tell us to do something that is contrary to our spiritual growth or development, what should be our attitude?','Parents are the first gurus because the baby learns to talk and recognize the world from them. Then a child grows up and develops his or her discrimination and chooses his or her own path, then contradiction arises. If the chosen path is conducive to one&#039;s self-development, even if it is not the same path as the parents, then the wise parents simply accept it. If both dwell in their own fanatic beliefs, then no acceptance, no compromise.'),(1,30,'Recently you said that we should put our self-interest at the back, that our duty is to see what is missing for someone, to provide that, and out of that we receive our share. If there is self-interest in one&#039;s actions, how is it possible to put it at the back? Even in putting other&#039;s interests first, still one&#039;s own self-interest is there.','That is the path of Self-liberation, to work with no self-interest and for the good of others. But life in the world needs some self-interest. Those who try to reduce their self interest, they progress spiritually.'),(2,30,'And yet self-interest is still present.','Yes, what happens in this process is that self-interest strengthens the ego. Others&#039; interests weaken the ego. The hardest thing is the easiest. But how to do it?'),(3,30,'It seems dangerous even on that path because more comes for me as well as others. So even this method can be a trap. As the accumulations come, I realize my own self-interest is satisfied.','That is the key we always forget in our own pocket. What is that key? Doing our duty in the world honestly and selflessly removes attachment in the heart. The fruit will manifest by itself.'),(4,30,'Can you say more about how the hardest thing is the easiest?&quot;','It is the easiest when one understands that I am only an instrument, not the owner, performer, etc. The ego is the hardest thing to remove but if we work as an instrument of God then it is easiest.'),(5,30,'In this country, there doesn&#039;t seem to be much survival value if a person doesn&#039;t seek for any self-interest.','It&#039;s a universal thing. In every country, every person is running to seek for self-interest. The question is how to liberate ourselves from the effect of seeking for our own self-interest. The answer is by being nonattached to the fruit of actions. To take action to help others with no self-interest brings a greater sense of peace. That creates a desire for more peace.'),(6,30,'Is it okay to focus on that peace or does one need to look beyond that to some higher purpose?','Yes. The peace develops when the restlessness of ego calms down. Ego is in the mind. It doesn&#039;t work separately from the mind. What is the cause of that peace?'),(7,30,'Reduction of self-interest.','In other words, by weakening the demands of the ego. Reduction of self-interest removes restlessness of the mind. Restlessness is the nature of our ego. Ego is desiring everything and getting attached to objects which makes the mind restless.'),(8,30,'What are the ways of changing our rajasic nature of devotion to sattvic?','The difference is only self-interest and selfishness. How to remove our self-interest is a big question. We could read great philosophies; we can follow great masters; but still we are bitten by our self-interest all the time. Why is it so? Rajas guna is passion. This passion is an expression of the ego. Passion is reduced by living a virtuous life.'),(9,30,'It&#039;s hard when we really see our suffering is caused by this.','It&#039;s hard because our ego wants to exist and exist with all powers. That power of ego comes by negative aspects of life. Think back in your own life. How much do you remember of good actions and how much do you remember of bad actions? Bad actions are always fresh in the mind. Good actions are vaguely remembered. Why so? In good action, ego involvement was little.'),(10,30,'If you are stuck in an ego position, how do you get from there to right action?','All are stuck there. The greatest power becomes the greatest obstacle. The ego is our power in all levels of life. As long as the ego is only for self-interest, it is an obstacle. If self-interest is reduced, the same ego is our greatest power to progress in spiritual life.'),(11,30,'I can&#039;t discriminate between the ego which is our power and also our sense of ownership. If a thought comes to my mind and I identify it with the ego as &quot;my thought&quot;, how does that relate to the ego as our source of power?','Ego is a notion of &quot;I am.&quot; In all identification, it is &quot;I-am&quot;. So all identifications are ego. It has a very short definition and yet it can&#039;t be defined in a few words. &quot;I am&quot; is ego. All identifications are ego. Identifications are millions. Ego is the expression of power too. But this power is for removing the negative power of the ego. Sense of ownership is in both positive and negative powers of the ego.'),(12,30,'In terms of the battle between ego and intellect in determining right action, it seems the ego is permeating the mind.','Intellect can discriminate; ego can&#039;t. Intellect knows the ego&#039;s self-interest. Ego doesn&#039;t know the intellect&#039;s discrimination. The ego is rooted in the intellect and becomes the owner of all the activities of the intellect.'),(13,30,'Why does the ego rooted in the intellect feel its existence more in negativity?','The intellect is a superior mind. It discriminates, judges, and decides, but all these actions of intellect are selfish. That&#039;s why it is said the ego is rooted in the intellect. In negative actions and thoughts, we feel pain, anger, fear, hate, etc. These negative feelings are deeply rooted in the mind, so naturally the experiencer, ego, is more in negative things.'),(14,30,'Why don&#039;t we learn more quickly from these painful experiences? Instead it seems that the intensity of the experience makes the ego go more in that direction.','In selfish life, there is pain, anger, etc. We are addicted to selfishness. So we don&#039;t want to change.'),(15,30,'Could you explain what it means to be selfless?','The Self has two forms: individuality and universality. Every living being lives with the sense of individuality but, except humans, no other species has the concept of universality. Individuality is established by selfish actions, desires and attachments. Universality is established when selfishness is wiped out.'),(16,30,'In Buddhism they say that you should do your spiritual practice for the benefit of all sentient beings.','It&#039;s a sense of universality. The Gita also says &quot;what is left for one who has achieved enlightenment, except to help others?&quot;'),(1,31,'How do the practices of Ashtanga Yoga carry over into the world when we have so many things to do and can&#039;t spend all day observing all the limbs?','Yama and Niyama, restraints and observances: they are in our every-day life. It&#039;s called spiritual life. Asana is exercise. For good health, you have to move around. Pranayama don&#039;t need several hours. Do simple breathing exercises for 10-15 minutes. Meditation: just sit for 10 minutes and don&#039;t think about the world. So it is all 45 minutes. If you have more time, then you can increase your practices.'),(2,31,'If my true Self is already liberated and needs no liberation, can I just leave my ego alone to enjoy itself?','If the ego is having a good time, then it&#039;s creating its trap. It&#039;s attached and addicted to good time; it is not liberated state. &quot;When the ego is left alone&quot; means it is desireless. Desireless ego dwells in eternal peace and that is liberated state.'),(3,31,'I hear so much about not wanting to be here or not wanting to be in a body. Everyone tells us to be light; but I am heavy. This makes me feel disturbed.','In our spiritual journey, what is the vehicle? The mind-body complex. If this mind-body complex is in good shape, then it will work better. So first duty is to keep it in a good shape. Then we have to find out which way to go. It&#039;s in a good shape but goes to a wrong direction. That is not good. Right direction we get by 1) satsang (association with others on the spiritual path), 2) swadhyaya (self-study and study of scriptures), 3) sadhana (spiritual practice), 4) selfless service. Not wanting to be here or in the body means not wanting to live in a state of ignorance. In the state of ignorance, the person is always living in fear, anger, pain, etc. That&#039;s why we say &quot;I don&#039;t want to be here.&quot;'),(4,31,'How do we understand spiritual progress?','Progress is known when there is a comparison. If two airplanes are high up in the sky and one is ahead, then we can see it. But if one airplane is flying up in high altitudes by itself, then we don&#039;t feel anything about the speed and progress. Spiritual progress is not known in this way by comparison with others. We can only say if our mind is not attached. That&#039;s our indication of progress. If our mind is developing selflessness, not craving for worldly things and feeling contented more, that indicates progress.'),(5,31,'I am a performing artist. Is there a contradiction between getting fulfilled with my art which involves pleasing an audience and the practices of Yoga?','You can do all those things but with an awareness that that is not your real aim. In the theater, you live the same kind of life. You play the part of a king. You come home and you don&#039;t feel like a king. In the art world, you are a different person who is working for others&#039; satisfaction but other times, you are working for your self-development.'),(6,31,'The component of a person&#039;s ego which causes us to want to live a spiritual life, how is that different from other aspects of ego?','Ego means duality. &quot;I am&quot; indicates there is something else. It&#039;s duality. What happens when the notion of &quot;I am&quot; disappears? The bucket of water from the ocean is sitting on the beach and someone pours it back in the ocean. There is only ocean, no separate bucket of water. We can explain it by saying ocean and bucket because both are perceptibles. When the universal ego is unknown and not perceptible, then we can&#039;t explain exactly what happens. The ego wants two things: 1) worldly experience, 2) liberation from the worldliness. When the ego sees the worldly enjoyments are momentary and the result is pain, then one seeks for spiritual path. The ego which is seeking for spiritual path and the ego which is seeking for worldly life are very different. The ego which is seeking for worldly life is rooted in desires, attachment, selfishness, etc. The ego which is seeking for spiritual life is reducing desires, attachments, etc.'),(7,31,'If we try to restrain ourselves from violence in our waking state, does the negativity or violence that we experience in our dreams change over time?','What is the difference between awakened and dream state? Dreams are caused by desires, imagination and memory. Awakened state also functions by these three and also creates more memories for the dreams to manifest. The violent dream is not separate from your awakened state. In awakened state the mind is distracted so you are not aware of those thoughts. In meditation or dream, the mind is blocked from getting distracted by several sense perceptions. So the memory is seen very active. It presents many past events which you are not aware of. Why in meditation all worldly thoughts appear? They don&#039;t appear. They are there. Only identified more. If we are living a spiritual life then all our actions, thoughts, speech will be spiritual. In our dream the memory of spiritual life will start predominating and violence will start decreasing.'),(8,31,'The path to selflessness is very tricky. What is the clearest way to get there?','The path of selflessness is hard when the mind is too involved in the world. It is easy when the mind shifts to devotion to God. Tulsi Dass writes &quot;O Lord, like a passionate man loves his wife, like a miserly person clings to wealth; in the same way I may feel love to God.&quot; The two examples give the feeling of intensity of love in a worldly sense. But if this same intensity of love is felt for God, that is devotion. A person who is devoted to God gradually develops nonattachment to one&#039;s own needs and thinks more about others who are in need. Such a person works for the good of others with no selfish intent.'),(9,31,'How can one be in a devoted attached relationship and also be devoted to God at the same time?','The union of matter and spirit is Yoga. In that union there is attachment and the purpose of this union is evolution. The same principle is in a devoted relationship. If they live a spiritual life together with one aim and purpose of life, then they are devoted to God.'),(10,31,'If we have been practicing Yoga as a householder, are there yogic practices we can learn now to practice in the dying process to pass to a higher place?','What happens at the time of death? The five elements get very active and change very fast. Create colors, patterns, human or demon forms, and the mind gets confused. Keeping memory of God depends on regular practice of spiritual life. When the divine form is soaked in the mind, then divine presence will be there at the time of death.'),(11,31,'Does a religion that uses as an object of worship a human figure who lived create more traps for the ego than a religion which uses mantras or symbols?','Forms or deities are reminders. Make a red circle and hang it in your room. Tell yourself, &quot;whenever I see the red circle I will remember God.&quot; You go out and forget everything. You come in your room and the red circle reminds you. So these forms we have accepted are reminders of God in our lives. The forms are not God but they bring the thought of God. In devotional path, God incarnates in human form are worshipped. It is a dualistic method of worship. In mantra and symbols, the mind goes to non-dual state. If the mind develops fanaticism in dualistic path, then the ego can create more ignorance.'),(12,31,'How is the samadhi state different from a state of deep sleep? In both the thought of &quot;I am&quot; is gone.','In deep sleep you lose outer consciousness and inner mind stops. You wake up and everything appears again as it was before. In samadhi, you lose outer consciousness. The mind stops but when you come out of that state you obtain knowledge of two things: 1) reality, 2) dispassion for unreality. If samadhi doesn&#039;t bring knowledge and dispassion, then it is no better than the sleep.'),(1,32,'In terms of the mind needing support, is that just because if it didn&#039;t have these supports, it would feel as though it didn&#039;t exist?','We have our limits but our needs in the world are vast. We cannot live in the world as we want without support in the world. When all supports crumble down by knowing that those supports are not real, then we seek support from God. To exist in worldly life we need support from parents, friends, society.'),(2,32,'But the mind is still seeking support.','Yes, the mind always seeks for support in our life in the world and also in getting out of the world.'),(3,32,'What is the relation between the mind and the support that it always needs support?','Because our needs in the world are vast and the mind alone cannot achieve all that we want. For our existence, we need support.'),(4,32,'Do we really let go of a support when we realize it is not supporting us? Or are there other reasons that prompt us to let go of a support?','We cannot live without supports. In worldly life, we get supported by everything. If we become detached from the world, we seek the support of God. If we realize something is not supporting us, then it cannot be considered as a support and we have to let go of it.'),(5,32,'When we turn our support to God, is that different?','When worldly supports crumble down. Then only do we seek for support from God in reality. It is different in the sense that it is for our liberation from worldly miseries.'),(6,32,'Then we seek spiritual supports. As long as we are alive, will we always seek for some kind of support?','Yes.'),(7,32,'What is your support?','Everyone, in my social life and no one, in my spiritual life, except God alone.'),(8,32,'All the people, you mean?','Everyone means everything, the whole creation.'),(9,32,'So everything supports us as long as we are alive? No matter how far we get? The earth is supporting us; the society is supporting us.','We eat; the food is our support; we drink; water is our support. We breathe; air is our support.'),(10,32,'So you are talking about practicality.','Life should be practical.'),(11,32,'When we seek support from God, is that really real? God is a presence that is always there. It&#039;s not that sometimes it&#039;s there and sometimes it isn&#039;t. So how real is that feeling of support?','Suppose there is no God but you believe there is. By your belief in God you create God within and feel supported. It is your faith and devotion which creates support from God.'),(12,32,'So how does support from God actually manifest itself?','It manifests the way we seek for it. Ramakrishna Paramahansa got it from his Kali deity. Ramana Maharshi got it from his own faith and devotion.'),(13,32,'There is a story that Buddha asked his disciples that if you had a raft and used it to cross over to the other shore of the river, when you get to the other side, will you continue to carry the raft? Buddha said that once you had reached to your goal, you would no longer carry the raft. All dogmas at a certain level become unreal and everything has to be abandoned. Any support.','Yes. That is a non-dual state when nothing exists as a support for the aspirant.'),(14,32,'I am trying to liberate the idea of looking to God for support. It&#039;s not like peace of mind. Would it be like faith?','Faith comes first. The Sanskrit term is shraddha; it means faith on &quot;sat&quot; or reality. If you are looking for God realization, then that aim is supported by the belief on God. Again it is a support from God.'),(15,32,'In beginning meditation, if you begin it by trying to take complete responsibility for yourself, even down to your heart, what impact would that have on establishing a relationship with the Self?','If you truthfully take responsibility of your achieving liberation, then that strength comes from the Self. We don&#039;t know God. We imagine someone is out there to liberate us. We know the Self (God dwelling inside). This Self is pure &quot;I&quot; sense and it is always with us in our evolution and involution. Because it is an eternal reality, so it is no different than God.'),(16,32,'And trying to become conscious of it.','It&#039;s the ego (I-ness) which is the enjoyer of life. It&#039;s your individuality; you are responsible for it. But it&#039;s very frightening without taking divine support. We take divine support by saying &quot;thy will.&quot;'),(17,32,'In saying &quot;thy will,&quot; how do we distinguish between &quot;thy will&quot; and &quot;my will&quot;?','&quot;My will&quot; is my ego. The ego is crying out &quot;thy will.&quot; In the beginning it&#039;s not clear because &quot;my will&quot; (the ego) is falsely crying out &quot;thy will.&quot; But it will get clear when the mind understands &quot;my will&quot; or my ego is limited.'),(18,32,'There is a loneliness in the world which is caused by separation from truth or God. There is also a loneliness that you have to walk the path alone.','Yes. Separation from God or Truth creates a loneliness which makes an aspirant to seek for God. The path to achieve liberation is internal, in our mind, so it cannot be shared, like you cannot share the taste of candy. Everyone should eat his or her own candy in order to experience the taste.'),(19,32,'I understand that to walk the path one must do it alone. Why is it so much easier to do a yoga class in a group rather than to have the discipline of doing it alone?','In the modern system, Yoga is becoming a group thing. I did not grow up with this kind of system. In my discipline, doing Yoga in front of anyone was forbidden. Because it&#039;s a personal thing. That is why yogis chose to live in seclusion.'),(20,32,'How does walking this path alone translate into this modern age?','In modern system, we learn by doing in a group of like-minded people. Support from each other. In olden system, that support is your own dispassion and devotion. By taking responsibility for your self-development. To do yoga with like-minded people is a big support for a lonely traveler of the divine path.'),(21,32,'How do we apply that idea of aloneness now? Sometimes it&#039;s easier to be alone in the context of a crowd than to be alone in the context of one&#039;s own head. How do you balance taking responsibility for your own self-development with all of our other responsibilities in the world?','Did you hear the name of Lahiri Mahasaya? He was a householder. He had a job in a military office. He had children and both his parents lived with him. He did all his duties and achieved his aim. A renunciate who renounces house, children, property, etc., goes in the woods and dwells in the memory of the past, is not a renunciate. So what is renunciation? We renounce the false notion we create that &quot;it&#039;s mine,&quot; &quot;I am the doer,&quot; etc. One who understands one&#039;s aim of achieving liberation is alone from the beginning to the end of this journey.'),(22,32,'Recently you spoke about yoga practice, that it used to be an individual practice and now it&#039;s a group practice. Do we then have to go back to an individual practice or do the same things happen in a group practice?','You have to practice always taking your own responsibility. Group practice is only for a support. Yoga practice should be a part of life and should be practiced every day. Going to group meditation once a week or month and not practicing every day will not fulfill the aim of liberation.'),(23,32,'Do you think that God has a mischievous quality?','Through the human ego. Without the human ego involvement, God is truth, reality, peace.'),(1,33,'In the Bhagavad Gita, it seems that true surrender comes only at the end of the path.','True surrender comes by knowledge. Untrue surrender comes by fear.'),(2,33,'At the beginning of the path, we may be willing to surrender but we are incapable of doing it at that point?','In the beginning the mind is pulled by so many desires. Even the wise fall back. Arjuna here says he surrenders. Later, again he argues.'),(3,33,'I think that surrender begins by accepting our negative side. Surrender can only begin by accepting that the dark nature is ours.','The ego is continuously fighting to retain its power. When two countries are at war, the loser surrenders. As long as the ego is not losing the battle of power, it cannot surrender. In spiritual life, we see the eternal and infinite power, God, and we see our own limitations. When our own limitations are realized, the ego immediately surrenders.'),(4,33,'I have a question about the humility that is necessary for surrender. The ego must recognize a superior entity. Where is the fine difference between humility and humiliation?','Humility is the act of humbleness. Not putting your ego above others. Humiliation is an act of putting others down by force.'),(5,33,'How do we judge who is superior to ourselves in every-day life?','It is natural to be humble before God or the teacher. The ego is continuously fighting for its power, knowingly or unknowingly. Even if we think someone is better, even then the ego will come up trying to find faults on that person.'),(6,33,'Could you talk more about surrender to the guru? Some people say that the relationship of the guru and disciple is based on obedience; others like yourself say it is based on trust.','Surrender means surrendering the ego. Surrendering to the guru means obeying and practicing the teachings with a spirit of surrender. Arjuna says &#039;instruct me; I surrender to you.&#039; Instructions would have no value if Arjuna would not carry out the instructions with surrender.'),(7,33,'Is there any other surrender except blind surrender?','Blind surrender is out of fear. Real surrender comes when one starts knowing the greatness of God.'),(8,33,'It&#039;s only out of great fear that Arjuna is willing to surrender. So the whole progression is about learning who you are and who you are surrendering to?','Arjuna&#039;s attachment. Attachment comes from fear of losing. Abhinivesha Klesha means attachment to life.'),(9,33,'Is there ever a positive side of not being a fighter, when it is not out of fear?','That is surrender.'),(10,33,'When I renounce or give up or surrender, I feel I am losing something too. Then my ego doesn&#039;t like the fact that I lost something and gives me a hard time. Is there anything I can do about that? For example, I stopped worrying about my position at work &#8211; promotions, salaries, or whether I am perceived well. My ego says, &quot;well, you should be more important there; you should push; you shouldn&#039;t accept this.&quot;','Attachment is there but the intellect sees differently. So within yourself you have two contradicting energies. One part is attached and one part sees it&#039;s not worth it. The fight goes on as long as the attachment exists.'),(11,33,'Ishwara pranidhana is mentioned in the Yoga Sutras in three different places. Once as a niyama, once as a practice in itself, and as a part of kriya yoga.','1) Niyama - surrender to God as a discipline. 2) In Kriya yoga it is a means of achieving highest samadhi. 3) Supreme dispassion. It is a state of complete dispassion.'),(12,33,'Could you say more about it as a means of achieving the highest samadhi?','Tapaha, swadhyaya, Ishwara pranidhana make up Kriya Yoga. Austerity, self-study and surrender to God constitute practical yoga. The three practices go together. These three practices remove attachment, desires and egoism, and samadhi is attained.'),(1,34,'If one is ill, is it normal to desire to be well and still at the same time to accept God&#039;s will?','We want to live and live in joy and happiness. It&#039;s natural, but when it doesn&#039;t happen even after our efforts, then we surrender.'),(2,34,'There&#039;s a belief in the New Age community that you create all your life&#039;s experiences. Do you create all the pain and illness in your life or is it just a samskara from another life?','Everything is created by samskara. But samskaras are seeds. They grow only in a conducive soil. We can change the soil; that is all.'),(3,34,'In speaking of how to overcome fear, you said when we accept we also create another trap of attachment. Can you give an example?','Any experience which is enjoyable we accept with attachment which gives rise to addiction.'),(4,34,'What about the experiences that are not enjoyable like sickness and pain?','That is surrender because it&#039;s not within our power.'),(5,34,'How does one surrender to God?','Our ego is the owner of our mind, body, actions, etc. This ego has no full control. It is limited in its powers. When it finds out its limitations, then it seeks for some higher power. The method of seeking is devotion to God which includes surrender.'),(6,34,'When we have a lustful or negative thought, what can we do in that very moment to remove it from the mind?','Whenever any unspiritual thought arises, we can remove that thought by bringing the divine presence within. How to bring the divine presence? By regular practice of surrender.'),(7,34,'I am wondering about contentment and surrender and how to discriminate properly to make positive choices in my life.','These all bring the spirit of surrender. What is surrender? When a king loses the battle, he surrenders. When our ego loses the battle, then it surrenders.'),(1,35,'You have said that very few people who practice yoga and meditation actually have their kundalini rise. If we do these practices and begin to calm and purify the mind, will there eventually be some experience that will develop?','In Tantra system, purification is the main object. Mantra, mandala, mudra: three instruments are used. By regular practice of tantra, the mind starts separating from all worldly desires. Tantra is a method for those who want to achieve liberation but can&#039;t control the senses. So tantra puts the practitioner, the senses, and the sense objects together. If a person has a great craving for pizza and somehow they see a great heap of pizza in front of them, then the craving will subside. Tantra works that way. Your senses and sense objects are together, but the mind is purified by Tantric practices so the craving for sensual objects starts diminishing. By practicing Tantric methods with a right aim, a practitioner will develop higher knowledge. Tantra means that practice which sharpens and expands spiritual wisdom.'),(2,35,'While you are in the process of purification, what is the kundalini doing at that time? Does it remain dormant until the purification is complete?','Kundalini awakens when all the nerve channels are purified. Tantra teaches that there are 72,000 nerve channels through the body. Kundalini is a dormant energy seated in Muladhara chakra. It can awaken accidentally, by certain herbs, by Tantric practices.'),(3,35,'Is the awakening of kundalini always very dramatic or can it be very subtle so that you are hardly aware of it?','It depends on a practitioner&#039;s emotional state. In some it is dramatic and violent, and in some gradual.'),(4,35,'Are the impurities of the nerve channels something that we are born with or something that we develop during life?','Impurities are imbalances of vata, pitta and kapha. And also, ego, attachment and desire. We are born with impurity of ego, attachment and desire. Those impurities increase when the mind gets involved in worldliness.'),(5,35,'I get the feeling that depending on what an individual&#039;s impurities are, that there may be an specific set of asanas. mantras, mudras, herbs or poisons that would be most appropriate for their purification. Is this so?','Everyone is different in physical build and mental make-up, so people choose the methods like asana, pranayama, mudras, etc. which are comfortable to them. But in the beginning, all can do the same practices. Only in advanced stage they create their own sadhana.'),(6,35,'Do these yantras have a symbology of their own or do you have to understand the symbols for them to have significance?','They are read like a book. Each mandala is a book. You read its gross, subtle, and causal meaning. Each mandala has a presiding deity and a mantra. Mandala term means circle. The bindu expands and turns into a triangle. The side of the triangles bulge out and becomes a circle. Symbols are created by human mind. Unseen, formless energy is seen and given a form in a shape of mandala.'),(7,35,'How do we practically apply the use of a yantra?','By meditating on the pattern. By knowing how to read them. How the energy is expanding and making shapes. The mind concentrates on that.'),(8,35,'Could you comment on Bhairavi, the terrible aspect of the goddess?','Bhairavi is the fearful goddess, the power of death. Destruction begins from the very first moment of birth. Death is ever present in everything. Bhairavi is a fearful-looking female servant of Shiva and of Durga.'),(9,35,'What is the cause of the obstacles to sadhana?','The cause is the ego. The ego appears in so many faces. If the ego is removed, then the whole tree of obstacles will fall down. Patanjali gives nine obstacles with five symptoms (Yoga Sutras I: 30,31).'),(10,35,'Would you relate samskaras to this? How do they fit in?','Samskaras are in the ego. As soon as the idea of I-am-ness dawns, the person starts creating samskaras. All positivities are samskara too, but the ego of individuality in positive samskara gets weaker and they do not obstruct in one&#039;s self-development.'),(11,35,'Is that similar to karma?','Karma is also a name for samskaras. In the west, they use karma term. Karma means action and the print of action in the mind. That is why karma is used for samskara.'),(12,35,'Could you comment please on surrendering to God? Sometimes I have trouble with that concept.','Surrendering to God means keeping divine presence in your heart all the time. In practice, whatever we do, we offer it to God. That creates surrender. As long as we keep the ego of being a doer or performer, we do not surrender. We surrender when we start experiencing ourselves as an instrument of God in performing action.'),(1,36,'With aging, some obstacles appear which weren&#039;t there before. Is it possible for a yogi in his 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s to do effective sadhana?','Dispassion and firmness in aim strengthen the will so much that nothing can obstruct. In aging, forgetfulness, loss of memory, inability to concentrate may develop, but due to the spiritual practice in mature age, samskaras are already formed. Those samskaras still work in a subtle level.'),(2,36,'Dispassion increases as one ages?','If the aim is firm, dispassion to the world will develop. But some people become more attached, greedy and discontented. It depends on each person&#039;s samskara.'),(3,36,'Could you talk about the aging process in relation to sadhana?','Aging is only for the body. If the mind is totally fixed in Aim, then body automatically remains behind. Yoga sadhana is not physical exercises. In the beginning the body is used in practicing asana, pranayama, pratyahara, etc. and later when the Aim becomes stable, only the mind proceeds forward.'),(4,36,'Could you talk about the difference between will power and aim?','Will power is in the buddhi. Aim is in the ego. &quot;I will do it.&quot; But the ego and Buddhi always work together because ego is deeply rooted in Buddhi.'),(5,36,'Mind is also part of the body and with aging loses some of its energy and ability to focus. So the aim is not as strong as the body declines.','Did Ramana Maharshi leave his Aim due to his terrible sickness? There was a saint named Hari Dass Yaman. He was a Muslim but he became a vairagyi monk. He lived in a cave and his practice was japa, non-stop, night and day. He got old, then very old, then sickness. But his aim, to do a certain number of japa before eating food, was never changed. He never stopped his japa yoga until his last breath.'),(6,36,'Is there a natural evolution toward the quieting of the mind? As we age, we naturally begin to limit stimulation, food became simpler, social relationships became simpler because we have less energy to deal with it.','Physical limitation is one thing; firm aim is different. In old age, all don&#039;t go to the same mental states. Some become very angry, disappointed and always try to upset others by their needs and demands, and remain discontented. Physical limitations do not limit the desire for worldly objects. Only rare people develop dispassion when they get old.'),(7,36,'How do we develop the great patience that&#039;s required of a yogi in non-achievement of a yogic state, in order to keep faith in the aim?','People easily drop out from small setbacks. Firmness of aim automatically brings faith. Without faith, the aim can&#039;t be stable.'),(8,36,'I find myself caught in the world of duality, where the need for establishing some security in the world is a distraction from my spiritual goals.','This is not a problem if we understand our aim and our life in the world honestly. When we mix them, then we blame the world for obstructing our spiritual life. Lahiri Mahasaya was a yogi, a householder, who had a job in the military. He had children, wife, parents, and a large family to support. How did he do? He had a spiritual discipline. Within that discipline he included his family responsibility. What do others do? They have no discipline so they work to support their self-interest (which includes family) and live a selfish life.'),(9,36,'Could you elaborate on using your householder life as part of your yogic discipline?','Householder life: 1) merged in attachment and no sense of duty of one&#039;s own aim of life, 2) merged in spiritual life where there is a sense of duty toward the family by keeping one&#039;s own spiritual discipline. Common people live one side of householder life who are in spiritual path. They think they are in spiritual path so they don&#039;t have a responsibility for the household. Or they think household responsibility doesn&#039;t give them enough time to pursue their own spiritual life. But there is time for both if they make their household a part of their spiritual life. They keep the attitude of a caretaker of the household and observe their spiritual discipline also.'),(10,36,'Isn&#039;t householder responsibility just part of one&#039;s duty?','Yes. But if the aim is spiritual, then both spiritual practices and taking care of household are duties.'),(11,36,'The commentary mentioned 1) delusion: thinking we have attained something we haven&#039;t, and 2) non-attaining. How should we observe our progress in sadhana?','Deluded mind is like a daydream. The practitioner only thinks I have attained this and that. In reality, the person remains in the same place. Non-achievement term indicates an effort to achieve. Like football players work hard, get knocked down, get up, run again and can&#039;t make it but doesn&#039;t stop playing the game. Our progress in sadhana is measured by 1) concentration deepens, 2) peacefulness increases, 3) the mind stops craving for worldly things as it was craving before.'),(12,36,'As a householder who is struggling to achieve a virtuous and spiritual life, my understanding has been that as one&#039;s spiritual life progresses and deepens, then the obstacles to one&#039;s worldly life also becomes less.','Obstacles are identified by the mind. When the mind is channeled towards the aim, then it doesn&#039;t identify such obstacles so deeply. The obstacles are there but the mind doesn&#039;t give much importance.'),(13,36,'According to the scriptures, householder means the large extended family, whereas today householder may refer to a couple who is simply living together with no intention of creating a family.','A man has several dogs, horses, goats; it&#039;s a family. In olden times, people lived vanprastha - wife and husband living alone in secluded places, a celibate life. Those who live a householder life in eastern system include the whole tribe as a family. In western system, there is no joint family system so every couple creates a family and their children create their own separate family. Householder means taking responsibility of family life together. &quot;Family&quot; can belong to two individuals as wife and husband, or it can include other members of their tribe. In Hindu scriptures, it is said &quot;Vasudaiva kutumbakam&quot; - the whole world is one family.'),(14,36,'So in non-achievement, effort is still made. The football player&#039;s mind is not on whether he is achieving or not achieving. He is just making the effort.','Effort to achieve is the main force in all our undertakings. If he keeps on trying, he may achieve another time? The player doesn&#039;t drop out, but always tries to achieve. Sometimes wins and sometimes loses, but keeps sports spirit alive.'),(15,36,'So there is still faith in the aim?','Yes.'),(16,36,'What would be the best attitude to take instead of seeking achievement?','Do your duty for God. You cannot create favorable result. A farmer works hard to achieve a good crop but when the crop is ripe, the hailstorm destroys it. So doing the duty is in our hands and the result is in divine hands.'),(17,36,'In finding the balance between worldly life and spiritual practice, suppose we have established a regular spiritual practice meditating early in the morning and then our worldly life requires that we arrive earlier. So you miss that time. It may help the work in the world but it weakens the discipline of spiritual practice.','In meditation class, if someone gets heart attack, what should we do? We have to see our duty in the world also. The class stops and everyone helps that person but it doesn&#039;t break the discipline. Next time, the class continues as usual.'),(18,36,'The mind can play tricks. It can think that scratching the nose is a heart attack.','There was a swami who started an orphanage in Almora. He was meditating in the morning sun, feeling good. A boy fell down from the roof and got a head injury. The swami ignored that child. The swami ignored his duty to take care of the child first. His mind made a reason to sit by using meditation as a pretext. We have to be honest to ourselves in our spiritual life.'),(19,36,'So often its just desire which is pulling the mind out. And it&#039;s hard to tell the difference between desire and duty.','It is always a desire, which pulls the mind out in the world taking various forms. Sometimes the form of desire appears as if very spiritual, but deep inside, there is a desire of name, fame, etc.'),(1,37,'You have written that &quot;God is love.&quot; How can I generate more love in myself? When I feel fear or other negative qualities, I feel I can rid myself of them if I could only generate more love.','Love is a state of mind where self interests are removed. The mind dwells in its natural state of sat-chit-ananda - existence, consciousness, bliss. Love is not created; it is a mental state which develops by living a disciplined life and developing positive qualities. Human ego is very attracted to negative qualities, so it needs much austerity to develop positive qualities.'),(2,37,'How is it possible to live in a marriage in a sacred way?','1) common aim, 2) spirit of compromise, 3) mutual love. Then the marriage will be two equal wheels of the chariot that roll together to the destination.'),(3,37,'How can we learn to differentiate between our monkey mind thoughts and the reflection of the divine mind of the Self?','All thoughts appear in the mind to support our ego existence by creating self interest. When the mind doesn&#039;t dwell in self-interest, it is divine thought.'),(4,37,'How can you tell which is which and discriminate between the two?','By knowing the self-interest in our thoughts and actions, we know those are ego-centered thoughts.'),(5,37,'Could the same be said for love? If the love doesn&#039;t involve self-interest, it is divine love?','Yes.'),(6,37,'Why does my mind enjoy and desire love instead of hatred?','Love in our worldly terms is a state which is enjoyed by the mind. Enjoyments, pleasures are called love, but it is not the real definition of love. &quot;I love to eat candy:&quot; what kind of love is there? It is a love which simply brings pleasure to the mind and senses.'),(7,37,'What is it that attracts the mind toward the pure form of love? What draws us toward pure love rather than the pure hatred?','In pure love, the ego remains unattached. In hatred, the ego is completely involved and expresses anger, fear, violence, etc. That is why we do not accept hatred, anger, violence, etc. We want to achieve pure love because it brings peace, contentment and happiness'),(8,37,'You said real love exists when all the mental modifications stop. Could you speak more about that?','When the mind doesn&#039;t seek its self-interest. The mind starts going inward. It is a state of peace or love. All pain and miseries arise when the mind identifies the world outside.'),(9,37,'I have a question about developing a connection between the head and heart. Sometimes I have a difficult time keeping that connection going and staying too much in the head. How would you advise building that bridge between the heart and the head?','The head is full of self-interest. The heart is full of love. Together they keep a balance. When self-interest increases too much, the person is only into his or her head and the heart becomes hollow. So ... watch your self-interest when you are too much in your head.'),(10,37,'That seems to be one of the fundamental aims of Yoga: to remove one&#039;s self-interest.','Self-interest = the ego functioning in the world. Our existence, needs, demands, emotions, etc.: all are based on the ego. The ego has two functions: 1) to function in the world selfishly, 2) to seek inner peace by renouncing self-interest.'),(11,37,'Are there yogic techniques to snap the ego back from its self-interest in the world? Like Thich Nhat Hanh suggests mindfulness of the breath and smiling.','Anything that works should be used. Philosophies don&#039;t work. Only practice works. Yoga means withdrawing the mind from outer world. The ego expresses its power in the outer world. By meditation the expression of the ego in the outer world gradually reduces.'),(12,37,'What do you recommend?','Watch yourself. If you start watching yourself, you will understand that the mind changes from moment to moment. Anger, greed, fear, violence in thoughts, love, compassion, happiness, etc.: they are always appearing and disappearing. So because we live in forgetful state, we don&#039;t notice it. We notice only what we want. The method of inhaling and remembering is all right. It can be done by various methods. Meditation includes prayers, chanting a mantra, and devotional rituals. All these methods are used to internalize the mind.'),(13,37,'The verse we chanted today (Bhagavad Gita XVII: 23), for example, suggests always keeping the thought of Om Tat Sat in the mind. What happens if any thought comes in the mind?','We take the form of that thought. If anger comes, we become a different person. If compassion comes, we become different. Om Tat Sat is a designation of the absolute God. By uttering Om Tat Sat, the mind will dwell on it and we will become that.'),(14,37,'Is it really that easy?','Yes. It is easy and extremely difficult. If the mind accepts something, it is easy to become that thing. But the problem is the mind doesn&#039;t accept so easily.'),(15,37,'Earlier you said that the mind is the thing that is changing all the time. Who is it that watches the mind? You said &quot;watch yourself; watch the mind.&quot;','The mind is changing and the mind is watching itself. The human mind has that capability.'),(16,37,'I have a question about the teachings of the Gita and teachings of the Buddha in connection with the realization of the Self. Buddha says there is no Self.','Buddha was a yogi who became enlightened but says there is no Self. Buddha was a great God incarnate because he introduced the idea of universal love. In his research of universal love, he found how that universal love and rituals of the Vedas are confusing and separate the humanity. So he removed those things and said &quot;mind and nature: there are two realities.&quot; Whenever people asked is there God, he did not answer. He taught the dharma, virtuous life, as a uniting force. The way he used the term dharma, sometimes it meant God, sometimes the Self. Buddha did not use the term Self. But he used the term higher mind or enlightened mind.'),(1,38,'In the Gita, Krishna says, &quot;I am seated in the hearts of all.&quot; Is that a general statement that God is within all beings or is it that it&#039;s recognized at the heart center?','God term is conscious principle in all living beings. That energy exists in all living beings. When someone dies, that energy separates from the mind-body complex. Human beings are more conscious of their life so they have more God consciousness. So the statement &quot;I am seated in the heart of all&quot; is correct. Here &quot;I am&quot; represents the Self.'),(2,38,'What does God want?','God within wants to live in peace. God without wants universal peace. God wants nothing because God is complete.'),(3,38,'Can you only experience God if you are in a mortal body and liberated?','What is that experience? It&#039;s the experience of eternal peace. But the peace comes in degrees. The more the mind gets pure, the more peace God is experienced. The mind-body complex is the instrument of experience. Liberation means merging in that supreme truth (God).'),(4,38,'Do you need a body to experience this relationship with God? Wouldn&#039;t the liberated person want to reincarnate in order to have that experience of the Self?','A light bulb is needed for the electricity to make light. There is electricity but without the light bulb it will not make light. Similarly mind-body complex is needed to experience divine presence within. If a person is liberated, it means the person is merged in the Self. No separate identity exists.'),(5,38,'We talk about freeing our mind from desires. But what about our desire for God?','Desire for God is called devotion. Desire and attachment are expressions of individual&#039;s existence or ego. &quot;I know I exist because I desire, I work to achieve, I fight, I get violent,&quot; etc. All these are expressions of the ego. The ego has a simple definition: &quot;I am.&quot; Desire for God is based on ego but this desire is for liberating the spirit from worldliness.'),(6,38,'How is the desire for God different? Does the &quot;I am&quot; diminish when we desire God?','Desire for God doesn&#039;t strengthen the ego of individuality (I-amness) unless there is pride in it. Human mind always clings to some object. If it clings to God, then its desire for the world weakens and vice versa.'),(7,38,'Can&#039;t you experience love and devotion for God and still be deluded?','Yes, it depends on the quality of love and devotion. Delusion is created by the ego. Delusion appears in an ignorant person&#039;s mind as well as in the mind of intellectuals. An ignorant person can have more love and devotion for God and an intellectual can have doubts about God. But when exclusive love for God develops, then no delusion can exist.'),(8,38,'My daughter lost a friend in a car accident on Christmas day. Is there any way besides listening that we can help her? I realize my understanding of death doesn&#039;t work for her. How can we help one who has suffered such a loss?','In pain people&#039;s minds are so confused that they don&#039;t listen to reasons. But we always play tricks in answering questions. We bring God or destiny. You can&#039;t answer why it happens. But you have to answer, so naturally you bring God in this matter. In reality God has nothing to do with it but you have to say, &quot;that&#039;s the way God wanted&quot; or &quot;it was her destiny&quot;.'),(9,38,'What could you recommend for my dry meditations? Feelings of fear and doubt are coming up. It seems to be a dry phase in my meditation.','Romance goes up and down. It&#039;s the same with God. If God would just give us $100 per hour to meditate, then we would go very deep, expecting that maybe God would give us $200 per hour. So a carrot is necessary for a donkey to run fast. I mean some spiritual experiences. Without going deep in meditation, we don&#039;t experience divine presence in a form of peace or bliss. Without having any experience, we feel meditation is dry. If you go on meditating even if it is dry, then one day it will change.'),(10,38,'Are there any accidents in the universe or is everything a part of God&#039;s plan?','When the cause is not known, we say it&#039;s an accident. God has no plans; it&#039;s all in nature. In nature sometimes imbalances in energies can happen.'),(11,38,'How does one offer all thoughts, feelings, and actions to God?','It is offered by prayer. It&#039;s offered by not seeking self-interest. It is offered by self-surrender.'),(12,38,'Who is the Self?','The self in the body is I-consciousness. The Self in the universe is called God or universal consciousness. &quot;I-consciousness,&quot; when it functions in the world through the mind and intellect, is called the ego (jiva).'),(13,38,'Would you please expand on the true nature of the Self?','The true nature of the Self is the pure conscious principle; that&#039;s all. But it reflects through the mind and intellect in all thoughts, actions, and feelings. It becomes ego of individuality (jivahood) and goes through the cycle of birth and death. All our karmas and samskaras are caused by the ego self.'),(14,38,'Would the human form of the God incarnation be just one form or could it have several forms at one time?','It can be one or several; it depends on the universal situation.'),(15,38,'Could God be incarnated without declaring that he or she is here?','The actions declare and not the words. The God incarnate&#039;s actions will be selfless and divine. That way the God incarnates become known.'),(16,38,'Do you feel that we are entering an age in which there&#039;s a decline in righteousness and an increase of materialism? And if so, is God manifested somewhere?','Everything gets old so the creation as a whole also gets old. As in old age, all kinds of problems arise. Similarly in nature all kinds of problems develop. Population increases. The earth doesn&#039;t increase. The atmosphere is polluted. It creates diseases, over-population, develops hate and violence. It is decline of righteousness. There is no other place to go. In such conditions, a reformist (God incarnate) appears and reforms the human society. The change can be violent or peaceful.'),(17,38,'How can we interpret the decline of virtue on a microcosmic level?','Microcosmic level in the decline of virtue means individually how much we are degraded from the spiritual path. Anger, lying, hypocrisy, cheating: all kinds of negative activities in our thoughts and actions indicate decline of virtue.'),(18,38,'Does God also take the form of evil?','Evilness comes from the egoism which is from prakriti (nature). But prakriti is not independent so we can say that both virtues and vice come from God.'),(19,38,'Could you comment on the statement that God neither punishes nor rewards?','It&#039;s one&#039;s own karma which brings reward or punishment. God is a conscious principle in all functions of nature. If someone lives a spiritual life, the person will be rewarded by his/her own spiritual samskaras. Similarly and evil person will get punishment.'),(20,38,'What does the divine do to protect innocent children from evil?','The divine or God directly doesn&#039;t protect but the divine energy in people appears and protects them from evil-doers.'),(21,38,'And when children have not been protected and have been hurt, what does the divine do to help them?','Again the divine doesn&#039;t help directly but through a saintly person the child gets help.'),(22,38,'Is there any difference between the person who gets enlightened and an incarnation of God?','In the Gita it&#039;s said that one who has known the Self becomes the Self or God. But here God incarnates have a special purpose, that is &quot;to remove evilness&quot; and establish path of spirituality. Enlightenment is in degrees. One who is totally enlightened is similar to God incarnate.'),(23,38,'Is there a person who fits that description of God incarnate at the present time?','Jesus Christ, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed.'),(24,38,'In reincarnation theory, there&#039;s a last life. That implies a first life. What would be the nature of the first life?','First human birth or life of a person who first incarnates? Different religions have different beliefs regarding human incarnation. Some believe humans are born as humans and some believe life progressed gradually to human form from a single-celled animal. In reincarnation theory, samskaras are considered the cause. Samskaras are the imprints of action in the mind. They are eternal. They temporarily become dormant but never get destroyed. According to samskara philosophy there is no first and last. It&#039;s a cyclic order which never ends. You can&#039;t be separated from God because the conscious energy in all beings is God.'),(1,39,'What is the yogic remedy to allow us to live in and enjoy the present moment, rather than dwelling in the past or the future?','In theory, it&#039;s very easy. Only a few words are used. In practicality, it&#039;s like a mountain standing in front of us. We are never in the present. We either dwell in the past or worry for the future. The present gets lost. If we veil our past memories somehow, then we are in the present. Think what kind of thoughts come in the mind. Thoughts of past and future, or thoughts of the present. Present has no thoughts; it&#039;s just existence.'),(2,39,'We know that the previous life samskaras come up in this lifetime; do samskaras that we experience in this life come up again later in this lifetime?','They come from the past. Past past and past present.'),(3,39,'If we are searching for peace in this lifetime, how much is that affected by the past?','We are living our past in the present. But we are capable to block the past in the present and live only in the present.'),(4,39,'Is a way to overcome the past to lead a spiritual life?','Overcome means samskara? Samskaras germinate if they get the right soil. If you don&#039;t provide the right soil, they don&#039;t germinate. If you don&#039;t go to a gambling place, you don&#039;t gamble.'),(5,39,'You said we could &quot;block the past.&quot; Do you mean blocking thoughts, feelings, actions? How do we really live in the present?','Living in the past memories. If a person who stole something from a store and then got caught and punished thinks about it after 20 years, he or she will be in the same pain as they felt 20 years ago. So we brought the past of 20 years into the present and lived in it.'),(6,39,'Is there a difference between living in the past memory and understanding the past, because both do bring up strong emotions?','What do you understand if that past is still keeping attachment? How it affects your present actions. It is affecting you because you are dwelling on it. You are not in pain if the memory is not there. It&#039;s only the memory which is causing the pain. Why is that memory coming up? Because we are attached to it.'),(7,39,'It seems that the attachment to the past memory may have something to do with not having fully accepted the pain of that experience.','Pain is never accepted because it is opposed to love for life. I want to apply that to the example of the memory which keeps coming back because there is something unfinished about the experience that needs to get finished.'),(8,39,'Example?','Someone who stole something and couldn&#039;t accept that their punishment has taken care of their actions, then the memory will keep coming back because they haven&#039;t fully accepted it. The ego doesn&#039;t accept any kind of loss. That boy or girl wanted something and stole it. When they were punished, they felt the ego was a loser. Ego always expresses itself in a negative aspect of life. If the boy or girl would not get caught and punished, then there would not be a memory or only a very faint memory. So when we dwell in our past, the ego expresses itself. &quot;I am alive; I am in pain.&quot; We create it.'),(9,39,'It seems to me that you have to resolve the problems of the past. How does that work in terms of a conflict in a specific instance in this life?','Yes, the past must be resolved. If we accept that what happened in the past can&#039;t be changed, what&#039;s done is done, then it separates the mind from the past. But everyone can&#039;t do it so easily. So we use different ways. In the Indian system, they do pilgrimage, ritual bath, worship, mantras, etc. By doing such things, the mind starts thinking &quot;I am really purified; I have done this, this and this.&quot; In the western system, they go to psychologists who use similar things in a different way. Past event doesn&#039;t change but the effect in the memory changes.  One could also resolve them personally by going back to the person and asking for forgiveness. If the person says, &quot;yes, you were wrong,&quot; then the ego will again stand up. Sometimes people do say, &quot;I was wrong; I am so sorry.&quot; This calms down the situation. But in another situation, it still exists. You can&#039;t go on making up with every person and every event. In yoga, we deal with it through the ego which is the cause and the experiencer.'),(1,40,'In studying the Samkhya Karika, the notion of manifest and unmanifest is presented. What is the third principle? Is it the witness?','Jnana term is used, &quot;the knower.&quot; The knower is the witness of the objects known.'),(2,40,'Is the knower the witness?','It is the Self, purusha.'),(3,40,'Is that different from the witness?','Same. Conscious principle alone is the witness. The unconscious can&#039;t witness. Manifest and unmanifest by nature are unconscious. Unmanifest is primordial nature. Manifest is the intellect, ego, mind, 5 subtle senses, 5 subtle elements and 10 gross elements.'),(4,40,'How do we develop neutrality toward thoughts?','Our ego of individuality is the biggest enemy of neutrality. It always works when the notion of neutrality is not there. What is neutrality for us when we are always seeking for self-interest? If we remove self-interest, then what will be the function of the ego? The ego will sit there dormant. In that state, the truth starts shining in the mirror of intellect. You can call it a state of neutrality because all aspiration and efforts cease. The ego merges in its own reality.'),(5,40,'Is the witness consciousness experienced only when the mind is still? Or is it possible to experience the witness consciousness during our normal awareness?','It witnesses all the time but we are not aware of it. In a car accident, people see a crashed car and do not look at the license plate. But when they are hypnotized, they can tell what was the license plate number. When the consciousness principle works through the mind, then the mind witnesses the perceived world.'),(6,40,'What is the relationship between the witness and enlightenment?','Enlightenment means achieving knowledge of the truth (Self). Witness is a conscious principle in the mind. Consciousness comes from the Self. So the Self is also called a witness.'),(7,40,'Is it possible to witness the witness?','Yes, it is in levels.'),(8,40,'So who is witnessing the witness?','The witness (Self) is witnessing the functions of the mind. It seems like two different rascals there. Witness witnesses the ignorant state in the mind. When the mind gets purified, the witness witnesses the pure mind as well as what was witnessed before.'),(9,40,'Is the witness part of duality or non-duality?','Witness as the embodied soul is duality but in itself it is non-dual. As long as the ego functions through the mind-body complex, it creates duality.'),(10,40,'Can the witness witness the different levels of enlightenment?','Yes. The eternal, infinite, the Self is the witness of everything.'),(11,40,'Is there such a thing as supreme enlightenment or is it an endless process?','Non-dual state is the supreme enlightenment.'),(12,40,'Is the witness the seer?','Yes. Seer means aware. These last verses are mainly talking about meditation and what we achieve by meditation. The human mind gets restless when one sits for meditation. A man went to a monk who was living in the jungle and asked him how to meditate. The monk said, &quot;just don&#039;t think.&quot; The man said, &quot;It&#039;s easy&quot; and got up and left. The monk yelled, &quot;one more thing. Just don&#039;t think, especially about a monkey.&quot; The man went home and started meditation. A monkey at first came in his mind. &quot;The monk said &quot;don&#039;t think about a monkey&quot; and I won&#039;t think about a monkey.&quot; But the monkey started chasing him everywhere. We carry a mind which always keeps a memory of those things which are not good for us.'),(13,40,'In the vipassana technique, the mind observes the sensations without getting involved or without creating thoughts. How does that tie into the concept of renouncing the thoughts as given in Samkhya Yoga?','If the sensations are watched without attachment, then the mind will not get involved in sensation because the mind enjoys sensation when there is attachment. We may think &quot;I am simply watching the sensation,&quot; but internally we are enjoying the sensation.'),(14,40,'The sense of enjoyment with which we watch our thoughts, isn&#039;t that part of the sattva?','Sattva buddhi is nonattachment. Sense enjoyment is an act of rajas guna. Its nature is desire and attachment.'),(15,40,'How do you find out what that duty is?','By being neutral, you will know.'),(16,40,'Sometimes my work is very fast-paced that it doesn&#039;t give me any time for reflection.','It&#039;s good. You can&#039;t reflect with restless mind.'),(17,40,'But I don&#039;t have time to reason out and reflect on my attachments. It&#039;s hard to witness in the middle of it.','You do it for your worldly life. Nonattachment doesn&#039;t stop you from working hard. It is not hard to see the self-interest and attachment.'),(18,40,'How can I practice nonattachment when there is not even the mental space to witness my reactions?','It&#039;s developed by training the mind. You have to have some time for meditation.'),(19,40,'At the end of the day, I&#039;m completely drained.','Because there is self-interest.'),(1,41,'In Chapter 3 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is saying to do your duty free from attachment for the sake of sacrifice only. So we have an individual ego, in a particular situation, with its own samskaras and self-interest, and yet we are encouraged to act without self-interest.','Binding and non-binding actions. Attachment is a feeling we create in the mind. A person gets married and gets attached to the other person. When they get divorced, the mind creates a feeling of separation. People remain the same; only the feeling changes. Selfless action without self-interest. The self-interest is not for obtaining any fruit for oneself, but the self-interest is only for the duty. The ego exists like the nirodha samskara exists, but that samskara burns itself.'),(2,41,'So the samskara that is produced by the action performed without self-interest is self-eliminating in the same way nirodha samskara is?','Yes.'),(3,41,'So the duty would also be the sense of being an instrument of God&#039;s will?','Yes, self-interest and universal interest. As soon as self-interest is weakened or removed, universal interest takes over.'),(4,41,'Can you tell us how to transform action into yagna?','Yagna is self-dedicated activity. There is no self-interest. In the absence of self- interest, the ego merges in its fundamental nature. That merger is like offering in the fire of yagna. When it becomes our nature to perform selfless action, then the ego of individuality can&#039;t live for long.'),(5,41,'Can you talk more about the meaning of self-dedicated activity?','Self-dedicated activity means selfless service. It is not forced by anyone. It is duty chosen by a person with complete devotion.'),(6,41,'Does that imply a will and an intention?','Yes.'),(7,41,'If everyone had the idea of sacrifice, would that change the environmental equilibrium qualitatively so people could live with less and not be so greedy?','If people live by self-dedicated action, then all problems will be solved. But, the ego has not worked out the bhoga (experience) yet. So the ego in a subtle way brings self-interest.'),(8,41,'So this kind of sacrifice really means doing the right thing all the time?','Self-dedicated action. Like the sun, for example, which is giving heat and light continuously.'),(9,41,'So when acting with the spirit of sacrifice, it&#039;s okay to receive the harvest because first there is an offering of the results of our action?','Yes. With that mental attitude, all works are performed. We offer things to God. God doesn&#039;t eat anything, doesn&#039;t need anything; then why do we offer? The offering affects the mind and accepts giving things away. Everything is only in the mind. You buy something: you own it; you sell it; you disown it. People get married and become wife and husband. They separate and that relation is gone.'),(10,41,'It seems that everything we do has some self-interest and also some sacrifice involved. In the process of doing actions in which there is both, if we forget the sacrifice and use it only for our self-interest with no element of giving something back, then that is the sin. These verses speak of bringing our spiritual life into the world. Are these universal truths about how to live life while reducing the ego?','We are born. We start seeing the world. Now what should we do in the world? &quot;The spirit of self-dedicated activity.&quot; That is what we have to do.'),(11,41,'Most people are thinking of their own needs and not thinking of making a sacrifice for future generations.','One 80-year-old man was sowing a mango seed. A young man saw it. He went to the old man and said, &quot;you are an old man. This mango tree will take ten years to grow and give fruit. By this time, you will be dead. You will not enjoy its fruits. So your actions are useless.&quot; The old man said, &quot;You are right if I would be sowing it to enjoy its fruit. The mango tree&#039;s fruits will be for others.&quot;');
