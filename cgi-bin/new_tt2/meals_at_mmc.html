<h1>Vegetarian Cuisine<br>at Mount Madonna Center</h1>
At Mount Madonna Center, we make an effort to provide delicious and
nourishing meals that accommodate our community and guests. All meals
are 100% vegetarian and we provide a vegan and gluten-free option at
every meal. We use organic ingredients as much as possible. We make an
effort to label known allergens. We do not cook with garlic or onions.
We do not permit guests to bring food from outside.
<p>
Reverse osmosis filtered water and tea are available 24/7 in the Community
Building, Conference Center, and Seminar House.
<p>
Some people have extreme sensitivity to certain foods such that even
the slightest trace amount of such foods can trigger life-threatening
allergic reactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that no trace
amount of any given food will ever appear in other dishes. Someone with
an allergy of such severity should know this in considering whether they
want to come to Mount Madonna Center.  A kitchen person will be present
at each meal for those who require more information or have further
food sensitivities.
