Q: How long does it take to get liberation?

A: There is no time limit to understand the ultimate truth. 
You can get it in one second or you can take several
lifetimes.  When a person attains human form, s/he is close
to enlightenment, but the sense of individuality becomes a
big block if not channeled in a right direction.  The human
incarnation is at the door of liberation all the time, but
our ego is keeping the door shut.  We can't see beyond our
ego-consciousness.
