When we talk about losing ego, we mean tamasic ego which identifies us with the world. Attachments. Ego to find God is sattvic and called devotion. Ego to do sadhana is rajasic ego and leads us to sattvic ego. Ego to be in the world, ignorance, is tamasic ego. We lose tamasic ego, and develop rajasic ego. We lose rajasic ego and dissolve into sattvic ego which is the Self. <span class=date>5/5/77</span>
