Q: When we experience fear in different situations (like
facing a mugger, as opposed to the Haunted House), does that
have a different effect (on us)?

A: In the first situation, the ego is prepared to defend
itself, so the mind carries a deep memory.  The second type
of fear is forgotten easily because the mind knows it was
not real.
