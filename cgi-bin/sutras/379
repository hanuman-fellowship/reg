Q: Specific practices of self-enquiry?
<br>A: Who am I? At first this is the only question the person can ask. In every action we have to question: Who is doing it? Who is the doer?
<br>Q: How is it related to the mind, body, and senses?
<br>A: By going deep into the inquiry, one begins to see the doer as separate from the mind, body, and senses. <span class=date>9/25/77</span>
