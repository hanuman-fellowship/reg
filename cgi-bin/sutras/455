Q: Is it necessary to experience the soul to believe in it?
<br>A: Our mind can identify with the reality which it experiences through the senses. The soul is experienced by higher consciousness only. A person can develop it, or sometimes it happens, and a person can realize that there is something that is the main force behind this creation. <span class=date>5/18/80</span>
