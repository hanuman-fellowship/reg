Q: How does one discriminate between accurate perception, or
understanding, and imagination or wishful thinking?

A: Accurate perception can't be defined as long as the mind
is colored by attachment, desires, ego, etc.  So we can't
say that what we are perceiving is reality as long as the
mind is not purified.
