Meditation is very easy. Try to pump out the air of thoughts from the mind. Sit and try to attain the thoughtless stage. That is meditation. To do it we do several other things, because the mind is very hard to control. Some do it by force, some are born with that quality, some do it by hard austerities, some do it by selfless work. <span class=date>10/31/76</span>
