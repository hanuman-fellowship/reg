Q: Is consciousness beyond the mind?
<br>A: Higher consciousness is beyond the mind. We are conscious of air, fire, etc. It is a lower consciousness. There is one higher consciousness that is developed when the mind is stopped, but it is shown through the mind. Like how far the moon is from this earth. Thousands of years ago yogis knew it by higher consciousness. Then the mind put it in miles. <span class=date>8/20/78</span>
