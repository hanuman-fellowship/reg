Q: I want to know about the ego: can it be our friend?

A: More than a friend, it is our life.  Ego works through
mind, intellect, and senses. Its field of activity is
desires and attachments (instruments) .... but one who wants
to get liberated from the cycle of birth and death, then the
ego should be separated from its instrument.
