Q: Is it necessary to sit to pray or meditate, or can one pray and/or meditate while working?
<br>A: Sitting is a method. There are several methods -- prayer, japa (repetition of a name or sound), chanting -- these can be done working, sitting, lying, or walking. But if we meditate, then we have to sit properly. <span class=date>11/16/80</span>
