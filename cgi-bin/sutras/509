Desire and attachment are not in the ego, they are in the mind. When the mind is free of desires and attachments, how will the ego express itself? The mind and ego get separated at that point. The impure mind means the mind controlled by the ego. The impure ego means the ego possessing the mind&#8217;s qualities. So in their union, they are polluting each other. When they separate, they both become pure. The ego goes back to its real nature as the Self. The mind becomes so pure that it only sees the Self. <span class=date>12/12/96</span>
