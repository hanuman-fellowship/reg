If a candle is lighted, its light will spread by itself. People read and hear so many good things. But they don&#8217;t do it. If one becomes truthful, peaceful, and loving, then one doesn&#8217;t need to say anything. But it&#8217;s our training period, so we say, hear, practice, accept, reject. When we attain that truth, then we don&#8217;t say. <span class=date>10/17/76</span>
