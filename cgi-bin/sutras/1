Q: How do the thoughts change in the process from working
only for self-interest to working selflessly (i.e. karma
yoga)?

A: ...to function in the world we need desire, attachment,
and ego. If the aim of a person is to help others and the
person removes his/her self-interest, then the ego,
attachment, and desire will act as a positive force.  -
