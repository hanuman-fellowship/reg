Q: We can&#8217;t get out of society as a group?
<br>A: Forming a new group is a way to have a good one, but when it gets large it will change. Sattva, rajas, tamas. Peacefulness, activity, dullness. This applies to everything. When the society is very large, tamas will come. Rigidity, inertia. <span class=date>1/9/77</span>
