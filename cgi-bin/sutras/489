Q: The Yoga Sutras say to develop an attitude of indifference toward the evil-minded or evil-doing people. How can this be cultivated? Seems difficult.
<br>A: Our own mind also possesses evil qualities, so at some level it is attracted to evil. If we remove our evilness, then it can be indifferent to the evil of others. <span class=date>11/16/80</span>
