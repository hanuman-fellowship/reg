Q: If you accept that death will come, you no longer care whether you live or die?
<br>A: There are two ways. One is seeing no one can save me from death. The other is accepting death because it is a law of nature. The first will bring pain and fear. The other will bring peace. <span class=date>8/23/77</span>
