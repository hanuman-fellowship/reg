Q: In what way is contact between people real, and in what way is it an illusion? Why do we seek it?
<br>A: Contact between people is always with emotion. In a worldly level, it&#8217;s real to us, but actually it&#8217;s not. Real contact is when the mind is free from all emotion. <span class=date>10/5/80</span>
