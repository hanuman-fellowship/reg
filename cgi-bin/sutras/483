Q: The expression &#8220;Be here now,&#8221; does it mean anything?
<br>A: It means paying attention only. If you truly think about it, then you&#8217;ll feel that the present is that moment that joins the past and future. Anything we do, it is in the past or it will be in the future. The present is only a moment. <span class=date>11/2/80</span>
