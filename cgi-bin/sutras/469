Q: How can we reach a state in which we can constantly see each other as God?
<br>A: Without identifying with the atman, it is not possible. Atman is the same in all creatures. In theory, we say God is everywhere, in everything. But actually we don&#8217;t believe it. <span class=date>8/2/80</span>
