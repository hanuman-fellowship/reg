Liberation is not something we get after death. We get in our everyday life. ... It can work out in a moment if the arrow hits the target. It&#8217;s only a matter of understanding.

Knowing truthfully this body is mortal will remove all fears, but we don&#8217;t accept it as mortal. <span class=date>6/3/99</span>
