Samskaras from past life can cause emotional imbalance. One method to deal with this is to dig it out, and other is to bury it completely, where it will never come out.
<br>Q: How to bury it completely?
<br>A: By forgetting. Accept your condition now and don&#8217;t dwell on the past. Samskaras can be burnt down if we can separate (from) the past. In samadhi it happens. The past disappears from the mind. Then the person cannot relate to the past.
<br>Q: When emotional imbalance is caused by samskaras?
<br>A: It can come out to burn, or it can come out to make more. It depends on your understanding. If you see it and understand it, it will burn out. If you don&#8217;t understand it, it will grow. <span class=date>5/6/77</span>
