Q: Is it the pain of death that people are afraid of?
<br>A: It is the fear of losing this reality.  Same reason that two people who hate each other will live with one another all their lives, because going outside that relationship is unknown.  A patient in much pain still wants to live. We don&#8217;t know what will be after death. <span class=date>11/16/80</span>
