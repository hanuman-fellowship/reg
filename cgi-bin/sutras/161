Q: How should we show love to others?

A: If you have love inside, it will spread everywhere.  Love
can't be made and shown if there is no love inside our
heart.  If there is love inside us we don't need to show it.
It will reflect by itself around us and will light the
hearts of others.  What we have to do: not to hate anyone.
