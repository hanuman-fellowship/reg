Q: What is forgiveness?

A: Forgiveness is forgetting the past actions of some outer
agency which created pain in life and not feeling the least
amount of anger or hatred toward the person.  As long as our
ego is strong, we cannot learn to forgive.  We always defend
our ego and are ready to take revenge in any circumstances.
