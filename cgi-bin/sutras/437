Q: Is everything we can imagine a memory?
<br>A: Yes, otherwise we can&#8217;t imagine it. In chit (unconscious mind) there is a print of the whole world. When a person attains nirbija (non-dual) samadhi, the knowledge of the whole world becomes clear, because it is already there. Only the veil is removed. <span class=date>9/23/79</span>
