Concentration will develop, whether by meditation or devotion or actions. The goal is the same. Concentration is the fastest method but it is very hard. You don&#8217;t have to have the aim of concentration. Other methods will develop it. You can walk on a path straight, or dancing and singing and looking around. <span class=date>7/16/78</span>
