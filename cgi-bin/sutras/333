Q: What is aloneness and how is it good?
<br>A: Dispassion is explained as aloneness, where mind does not want to identify with anything inside or outside. Samadhi is extreme dispassion, where the mind does not even want to breathe. So the result of sadhana is dispassion, which brings wisdom. Extreme dispassion and wisdom together reinforce each other and bring nirbija samadhi (non-dual state). <span class=date>5/1/77</span>
