Q: If so much of our lives is determined by karma, action and samskara, is there free will, and how much?
<br>A: Free will is only to do purushartha (action to attain God). In the process of purushartha, all other things are eliminated. If we were going to eliminate karmas and samskaras one by one, there would be no end to it. <span class=date>7/20/80</span>
