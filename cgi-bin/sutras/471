Q: Where does a sense of humor fit into a nonattached attitude?
<br>A: Humor comes up when the mind is freed from all pains. Nonattachment doesn&#8217;t make a person like a rock. Only the idea of attachment is removed. Ramakrishna Paramahansa was a great actor, yet he was nonattached. Shirdi Sai Baba was a wrestler. It doesn&#8217;t affect their dispassion. <span class=date>8/24/80</span>
