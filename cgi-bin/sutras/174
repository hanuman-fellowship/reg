Q: Why do innocent children and people suffer and get killed
by wars?

A: Madness.  When the millman grinds wheat, several wheat
worms get crushed.  In human madness, several innocent
people are harmed.  The world is no wiser in that respect
from the Stone Age.  We are still seeing it in so many
countries....
