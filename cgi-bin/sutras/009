Q: How do we develop compassion? What is its place in
spiritual life?

A: Compassion means deep sympathy for the sufferer. One
cannot show compassion without developing it inside. When a
person starts feeling others' pain, misery, etc. as her own,
then compassion develops. Compassion is a mixture of love,
nonviolence, and kind-heartedness.
