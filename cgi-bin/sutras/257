To enjoy yourself is not an easy thing. It comes by contentment. As long as the mind is not contented, we run around trying to get things and don&#8217;t get anything. Contentment is attained by sadhana. Mind rejects the world when it can&#8217;t find God (quickly), showing as discontentment. <span class=date>7/11/76</span>
