Q: Judging others?
<br>A: To judge is the mind&#8217;s natural function. But when the ego is involved, judgment is from the ego and not real. It is what created disharmony among people. You can stop that tendency in yourself by saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need to judge others, I can judge myself.&#8221; <span class=date>3/23/80</span>
