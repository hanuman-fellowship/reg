Q: How does one develop faith in order to be a better yogi, using the Bhagavad Gita as the example?
<br>A: An individual has two energies, positive and negative. In the Mahabharata, this battle is explained symbolically. You have to fight, and the enemies are already dead. This is the cycle of this creation, but still we have to fight as sadhana. Negative qualities will be eliminated, whatever we do, because creation started from sattva (purity). <span class=date>6/22/80</span>
