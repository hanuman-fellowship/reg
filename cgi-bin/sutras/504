It is very hard to convince a dying person that it is okay to die, because the same fear is within us. So the person doesn&#8217;t believe us. We can&#8217;t stop a boy from smoking when he sees us smoking.
<br>Q: How much to give?
<br>A: You can only show your love and not to reject them. That gives a good support. If someone accepts death, then they don&#8217;t care about someone&#8217;s support.
<br>Q: Overcoming the fear of death comes at what point, and makes what difference?
<br>A: Vast difference. As soon as fear of death is removed, all miseries are gone. Fear of death makes us cling to the world. This clinging is like an orphaned monkey clinging to a stuffed monkey, thinking the stuffed monkey is its mother. This ignorance is removed. <span class=date>9/4/81</span>
