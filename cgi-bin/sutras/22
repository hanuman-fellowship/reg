Q: How do we develop compassion while we are trying to
develop detachment?

A: As long as we are defending our ego, we cannot develop
true compassion. All that we see is "I am," "mine," "for
me," "to me," and so on. When our mind is always busy
thinking about ourselves, then it can't perceive the real
nature of compassion.
