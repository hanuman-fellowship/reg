Realization means to realize something is there. If you see a snake, you do not step on it. Seeing an obstacle means it is not there in the same way as before. Obstacles are there by ignorance. Ignorance is the main thing in pravritti [outgoing mind]. How do you see clearly? Yoga sadhana opens the third eye and it sees clearly. <span class=date>10/5/76</span>
