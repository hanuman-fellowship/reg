Q: Why is pranayama considered the highest austerity?
<br>A: Austerity means to control desires. The highest desire is to live. By pranayama, this desire to live is wiped out. If prana, the life force, is controlled, then you don&#8217;t care about this life.
<br>Q: Doesn&#8217;t wiping out the life force by austerity become suicidal?
<br>A: Suicide is a fear of living. You are still caring. <span class=date>7/1/79</span>
