If negativity is stopped within, negative thoughts are stopped, then you can&#8217;t get it from outside. If looking for God outside, see it in everything rather than looking for a specific form. Higher power, God, is inside and outside. The curtain of this body separates the two. If you find it inside, the curtain will drop away. <span class=date>8/14/77</span>
