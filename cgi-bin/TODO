    2 .tt2 email message
sutra1
sutra_send  - broken - send from akash instead? yes?
    get the sutras data as well
talks_search? and talks data
    how to get this?
    ask the Babaji group what they're up to
        and if they want these talks.

Can we can switch over to these akash cgi-bin scripts BEFORE
    the new web site is ready?
    One by one.
    And style them better later.

Does grid need to be styled better?
    Yes?  No MMC logo at all...

Rental Deposit - received - update contract_received date
    and the rental status.

Meal Request - maximums?
    notify meals@mmc
