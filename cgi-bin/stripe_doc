When you want the customer to pay create this curl command:

The key at -u is different - from the dashboard (API keys)
metadata is basically a hash of your creation
    up to 50 keys
    each key is at most 40 chars long
    each value at most 500

curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -u sk_test_CTgcxK02ela76EawraITgSdd00oyIH2lsp: \
  -d "line_items[0][name]"="a big thing" \
  -d "line_items[0][amount]"=19900 \
  -d "line_items[0][currency]"="usd" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=1 \
  -d "metadata[hello]"="hello there" \
  -d "metadata[rental_id]"="89123" \
  -d success_url="https://akash2.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/thank_you" \
  -d cancel_url="https://mountmadonna.org"

The output of the curl command is captured.
In it is a JSON string which contains a url key.
Redirect to that url.

After payment the webhook for checkout.session.completed is called.
Extract the params and act on them.

Can add -d customer_email="hello@bye.com"
    and it will appear in the payment dialog

What about customer_name or customer_zip?

Docs:
    https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create

Perhaps create a customer first with Name, Zip
    and then reference that customer when creating the charge?

On the checkout page there is information about
creating a Link account - and then there is a "1-click checkout".

This may be best - perhaps the person with the card
    is not the Rental Contact person...
    There is also ApplePay
    and Link - the pay faster 1-click thingy
    I don't need to understand or facilitate that.
    Is it okay to insert the email address?  I think so.

Questions:
    key for actual (not test) payments??

    from Shantam:
    my $stripe_key = "sk_test_CTgcxK02ela76EawraITgSdd00oyIH2lsp:";     # test
        copied on 1/22/23:
    my $stripe_key = "pk_test_9dgtGZ9aTJDYHsPRvJEiIEAT00g77ndlOd";
    my $stripe_key = "pk_live_n31B5r1y0q0QMvLfeAqMmTNH00amiaUNQ2";
    Which is right?

    How to void an unsettled transaction?
    How does the accounting office deal with the Stripe payments?
    Can we just start using Stripe instead of authorize.net?

    Certain email addresses do not work and Stripe gags on them
        giving an error.
         j@x.c is ok
         j.@x.c is ok
         .j@x.c is ok

         j@x is not ok
         j@.c not ok
         j@c. not ok
    So what is a regex to validate the email address?
