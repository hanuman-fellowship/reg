When you want the customer to pay create this curl command:

The key at -u is different - from the dashboard (API keys)
metadata is basically a hash of your creation
    up to 50 keys
    each key is at most 40 chars long
    each value at most 500

curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
  -u sk_test_CTgcxK02ela76EawraITgSdd00oyIH2lsp: \
  -d "line_items[0][name]"="a big thing" \
  -d "line_items[0][amount]"=19900 \
  -d "line_items[0][currency]"="usd" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=1 \
  -d "metadata[hello]"="hello there" \
  -d "metadata[rental_id]"="89123" \
  -d success_url="https://akash2.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/thank_you" \
  -d cancel_url="https://mountmadonna.org"

The output of the curl command is captured.
In it is a JSON string which contains a url key.
Redirect to that url.

After payment the webhook for checkout.session.completed is called.
Extract the params and act on them.

Can add -d customer_email="hello@bye.com"
    and it will appear in the payment dialog

What about customer_name or customer_zip?

Docs:
    https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create

Perhaps create a customer first with Name, Zip
    and then reference that customer when creating the charge?

On the checkout page there is information about
creating a Link account - and then there is a "1-click checkout".

This may be best - perhaps the person with the card
    is not the Rental Contact person...
    There is also ApplePay
    and Link - the pay faster 1-click thingy
    I don't need to understand or facilitate that.
    Is it okay to insert the email address?  I think so.
