    script/ren.pl
        creates req_payment - new table replacing req_mmi_payment
            with additional org column (mmi/mmc) default 'mmi'
        and copies data from req_mmi_payment
    delete table req_mmi_payment
    req_pay - new column in program where school_id >= 2 (mmi)
    string name changed - mmi_payment_request_signed => payment_request_signed
    string name changed - mmi_payment_request_from => payment_request_from

    template name changed letter/ignore_mmi_req_payment.tt2
                       to letter/ignore_req_payment.tt2
    template name changed letter/req_mmi_payment.tt2
                       to letter/req_payment.tt2
    template name changed finance/req_mmi_payments.tt2
                       to finance/req_payments.tt2
        done in git

    new strings req_mmc_dir, req_mmc_dir_paid

    Financial listings - all payment requests - too many!
        have a date range?

    TEST PLAN
        - what about default organization for a new requested payment?  MMI or MMC?
            ask Manjarika
        - add several MMI, don't send yet, delete one
        - add several MMC, send them, check email, delete one - check email sent
        - add one of each type (MMC/MMI), send them, check for two emails,
            delete one - check email sent
        - check that they arrived on the two sites

        for these - grab_new is needed - be careful to not clobber the real Reg data
        - add MMI, send, receive, make payment
        - add MMC, send, receive, make payment
        - add both MMI and MMC, send (both will go), receive both, make payments
        - add both MMI and MMC, send (both will go), receive both, make just one payment
Apr 22 1:00-3:00
    begin expanding payment requests to MMC
Apr 29 1:50-4:00

Jun 28 11:30-12:30 
    demo'ed DDUP to Jamal, gathered suggestions:
    links below status - with clobber
    3 lines - to the right of the other menu items

    append same records?  What if changed? ignore the expiration date?
        make it conditional - append if current exists
            otherwise require the expiration date
        hmm.
        if no DDUP in progress (no exp date)
            require an expiration date and
                the button is labeled "Run Report".
        else
            you WILL be appending and
                the button is labeled "Run Report and Append to Current DDUP".
        you can always do "Count".

    hacker block tweak? for 10, To Jamal as well.
    log who and what report's output was sent to mmc
