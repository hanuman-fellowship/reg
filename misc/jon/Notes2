to-do items from testing with Laura:

---
alphabetize testplans
alt-enter for full screen - browser skills
show search pattern on results page?
label for Inactive, Deceased - 'Status'
    and don't show if neither
add space between addr1, addr2
no tab to Share, Home then Work?
Alert when registering rather than Pop Up?
sort affil list ignoring case - nah
Separate bombs - tt_today?
doc in browse skills - print background colors
updated date is not start date of program
    they registered for - it is the current date
delete a person - what about their donations?
import all housing from cur on.
purge email response - better?
    not sure what this is...
edit Misc - stay on Misc
stay on tabs for Rentals editing
RAM 1 <-> 2
update Lunches
    did not consider extra days
manual reg - default Double for h_type
book clusters for Rentals - order?
No Where - not working?
If no CEUs in program, say so when asking for Program CEUs.
update Lunches, Leaders, Meeting Places, Affils => back to same tab
L, H, X => graphic icons of
    envelope, house (small version of same), red X (stolen from Netflix?)
"Pay It" - replace with a dollar bill graphic
Own Tent - house picture?
on reg screen - Charges to the right?
    payment, history down below
    I think not.   Too much info - becomes noise.
extra days - Name From To add "Plus..."
    does it look too noisy?   or is an extended program
        just innately complex so it _should_ look noisy?
    better way?  Heading for Lists, Tally is cleaner.
link for quick notes in separate window
    in 3 places - reg screen, update conf note screen,
        and on housing screen
on housing screen
    put space for conf note
allow an easier way to change housing type - from
    the choose house screen
    also - show both choices of housing (if available from online)
housing choices on house screen not second choice.
Early/Late listing - respects extended programs...
    not done yet
other cronjobs:
    make up list
        works okay - sets the 'next needed' date.
            might that date may change before the bed is ready???
                may change earlier or later.
            yes.  should we worry about it and every time
                the make up screen is shown should we look again?
            maybe.
    grab online

    need to set properly with crontab -e
        what time?
GrabNew elsewhere - or 'Online' since grabbing new will be cron job
    on Program list screen only - okay?
    also on Registration
    Grab New only on Online list screen
Cancellation - be sure to vacate the house, Deletes, too.
    done, yes?
PublishPics as a separate link
in Online list make program name a link
in DailyPic, ClusterView - popup shows kids, if present
Registrations link on top of Summary
calendar - set end date, not show images etc
all lunches - check "all"
assign meeting place - order by disp_order
reset display colors to default
footnotes #->%?  correct?
add house to Rentals - list too long
    sorted by priority, limited select options, Resize at bottom
No lunches for PR
rentals
    add rental -start on Finance?
    deposit required? on rentals?
    after creation - what tab is shown?
---
Center Tent spaces should be available during
    winter for Own Tent people

Summary - need Plus ... for extended programs


web design - no change of color if clicked on
deposits - since last deposit, save it
month-end report?
VPN access
too many windows open for membership activity
colorization of R for rentals?
    better - show first 3 (or 2) letters when radio button is chosen?
Summary tabs into field gos to second line?
    tabs should not go to Submit
On reg1.html explain special requests
    special foods, kids, early late, snoring
wrapping in comments entered online?
history records for which house relodged, vacating?
    maybe
in middle of reg on another window - go to a program
    opens up yet another window or does it clobber the mid-reg?
submit reg - fails network, on refresh gives sdate error
    prohibit double reg
in History - conf letter REsent
font - not always Verdana in IE
    sometimes not always
red arrow for moving - didn't pop up - why?
    window already existed?
confirmation letter - KayaKalpa is too much
printout of confirmation letter should be smaller font
lsw, LSW, online reg - case insensitive
    try LSW when only nurses?
CEU license cost, kid cost, extra day cost, discounts
    should this be mentioned near Special Requests?
    how do PRs work in this regard?
    online PRs request arrival, departure dates?
manual reg - defaults to PR - the _current_ PR
Firefox - better tabbing, opening of other windows/tabs?
    should we require Firefox?
unlinked dir for PRs?
PR screwed up charges?
    negative # of days?
online evaluation form
    records w/ program id, name, date - ftp'ed from mmc.org to kali
are receipt numbers necessary?  == payment record id
no expiration of session?
MMI
    import from D/C/M programs
    go to the _one_ D/C/M program
    MMI charges, payments are linked to the person not the program
        including course housing etc?
on housing screen - show kids if present
only one reg screen - don't keep opening new ones?
    maybe maybe not - can modifier keys override naming a window?
search online list for roommates before
    saying they're not there at all.
capitalize first, last names (Mc O') on entry online
    for normalization
no double reg in program with same name/person id
on first Registration screen "Submit" -> "Register"?
    maybe
Forcing into another type - should we change h_type automatically?
    better - after a force - display the fullness of what they
    have done.   all residents of the room, their h_type
        plus kids
Sharing overides no bed? :(
assistant * - legend on Leaders screen
Color instructions on all pages - not just Display
    a way of not repeating all the color code?
Change password - error on success?
Tally - heading 'for' 'from'?
    no Tuition, Lodging, Adjustments
    "To Program" bombs
List of all current programs should show
    programs with extra days that have not quite yet ended.
Check Early/Late list considering extended programs
View Rental - diff display background - td elements?
For extended programs initial reg screen should say so (view too)
    "Plus 3 days to 11/9"
do program staff have access to member info?
    should they?  not write access.
    they might get questions about # of days left...
ajax on all regs screen
No Where - didn't show until = 9?
Donations - not in New Deposit, payments _are_ there.
negative balance not offset by negative charge?
    try to reproduce:
    w credit of -50
    deposit of 100
    & free program
Late Notices
    cluster name does not read properly.
    perhaps don't try to put in a sentence - rather in a tabular form?
    cabin, tent, room - not just room.
    
    how does the Confirmation letter read?
when duplicating a program - the leaders are duplicated
    but not registered.
...
Green Fund - new well known Project
    on reg1.html have place for entering a dollar amount
    to be included in the credit card total
    a link explaining it in separate smaller window
    x_green 40

    generates acknowledgment letter
    project page shows all by month, with subtotals by month
KayaKalpa changes
    in reg1 link to their page, email address
duplicate program with extra days??? does it work?
no Submit at bottom of Web tab of Program
    colorize the one that's there?
feedback while Publishing
the program default template
    check in begin, end times
    orientation = program start
    end time of program
doc: blank line before # in shortcuts
need help link for shortcuts
errors on website - can we put focus on erroneous field?
    rather than just 'back'?
for conf letter
    when does office close?  not always 6:30.
    invoice table - needs cell padding
        okay on MacBook Mail, Safari not Outlook on IE
carpool
    say 'as of' date.
    cronjob will send one week before program
        Bcc'ing registrar (who?) - all program admins
in blitz reg screen (AllRegs) the program date
    is not complete - do like Lists, Tallies?
dashes under charges, payments on reg screen
    not visible in IE.
prohibit sending confirmation letter
    unless housing has been set.
program dates: From 12/23/08 Tue To 12/25/08 Thu Or 12/28/08 Sun
    dates bold, labels not bold, DOW red not bold

protect against dups when backing up
    adding registration, program.

pay it in rental - not the balance?




future...
enter zip => city, state?
    for phase two - not really needed since most reg is online
ajax cluster assign to program - iffy on IE?
    how does it not work?  okay on Safari locally.
dup check - when is it done?
    enter exact dup names, with address
        no dup warning?
Partnering not found?
dups, search for partners - still some trouble there
doc: calendar - end date calculation may include
    one more month if an event that starts earlier overlaps into it.
initial focus of summary, tab order?
+2 for extended does not show
on program - Registrations or AllRegs or FirstReg 
program tally - tally genders/kids before program happens
    attended then blank, then gender tally
    also do the tuition tally
program staff cannot add houses - don't offer it
templates - some should not show
