to-do items from testing with Laura:

---
THESE ITEMS ARE DONE:
alphabetize testplans
alt-enter for full screen - browser skills
show search pattern on results page?
label for Inactive, Deceased - 'Status'
    and don't show if neither
add space between addr1, addr2
no tab to Share, Home then Work?
Alert when registering rather than Pop Up?
sort affil list ignoring case - nah
Separate bombs - tt_today?
doc in browse skills - print background colors
updated date is not start date of program
    they registered for - it is the current date
delete a person - what about their donations?
import all housing from cur on.
purge email response - better?
    not sure what this is...
edit Misc - stay on Misc
stay on tabs for Rentals editing
RAM 1 <-> 2
update Lunches
    did not consider extra days
manual reg - default Double for h_type
book clusters for Rentals - order?
No Where - not working?
If no CEUs in program, say so when asking for Program CEUs.
update Lunches, Leaders, Meeting Places, Affils => back to same tab
L, H, X => graphic icons of
    envelope, house (small version of same), red X (stolen from Netflix?)
"Pay It" - replace with a dollar bill graphic
Own Tent - house picture?
on reg screen - Charges to the right?
    payment, history down below
    I think not.   Too much info - becomes noise.
extra days - Name From To add "Plus..."
    does it look too noisy?   or is an extended program
        just innately complex so it _should_ look noisy?
    better way?  Heading for Lists, Tally is cleaner.
link for quick notes in separate window
    in 3 places - reg screen, update conf note screen,
        and on housing screen
on housing screen
    put space for conf note
allow an easier way to change housing type - from
    the choose house screen
    also - show both choices of housing (if available from online)
housing choices on house screen not second choice.
Early/Late listing - respects extended programs...
    not done yet
other cronjobs:
    make up list
        works okay - sets the 'next needed' date.
            might that date may change before the bed is ready???
                may change earlier or later.
            yes.  should we worry about it and every time
                the make up screen is shown should we look again?
            maybe.
    grab online

    need to set properly with crontab -e
        what time?
GrabNew elsewhere - or 'Online' since grabbing new will be cron job
    on Program list screen only - okay?
    also on Registration
    Grab New only on Online list screen
Cancellation - be sure to vacate the house, Deletes, too.
    done, yes?

when duplicating a program - the leaders are duplicated
    but not registered.  should be.  not housed, however.

rental bookings - how did vishnu dev, mmi-lele get a booking????
    reload and check hcck!
Perday => Per Day

to do for proposals:
    the list should include status, max, and dates requested
    add affiliation for "Rental Coordinator".
    add link to 'Transmit' the person and another 'Convert' for the proposal.
        Converting the proposal automatically transmits the person
        after which 'Transmit' is shown as "To Person"
        and 'Convert' as "To Rental".
        rental_id and person_id become non-zero
        read-only values for the person's demographics after transmission
        the proposal values (Group Name) cannot be changed.
            nothing else matters - they are not 'converted'.
    on transmitting - update an existing person record
        with the current info

leaders of programs - should the link on the program screen
    for the leader take you to their leader info or to their
    registration for this program?
donations, payments
    list type of payment, date in both??
delete person - linked to proposals???

add/update person as proposal submitter
    also change date entered, updated.

use 1st 3 alpha letters of address for the akey
optionally collapse same addresses and add et. al.
    and show the addresses - somehow
get all data from old reg/mlist
    new listing: inactivation step
    with a date parameter
    followed by counts of reports
ask Luke about standardization of addresses via a web API.
MMI programs - what to do?
    they will occupy meeting spaces and housing
        so we do need to show them to everyone.
        otherwise in the daily pic there'll be someone
        you see but that if you click on them you see nothing!
need to get extra accounts still - and the payments?.

mmi payments - when in course allow only tuition, meals and lodging or Other?
    and when "To DCM" allow only App Fee and Reg Fee or Other?
    or tuition only in DCM unless it is an auditor?
    tuition on a mmi course program is the tution for just
    the one class.  in a DCM it is the tuition for the entire
    program.

rental add house - make it a table of checkboxes

charges for MMI program - none for D/C/M? but yes course.
    but no tuition - yes lodging

add attributes to mmi_payment - reg_id and note
    decipher reg_id from gl number in existing payments
        too hard (or confusing!)   n_in_mon or level???? glnum????
        settle for future payments?
        it is the D/C/M program start date (6th digit is D/C/M)
        for auditors the payment is attributed to the course itself.

        weird design!
        the information about which course the meals/lodging was
        for is lost... we could guess by looking at the date of
        payment - but should we?

        perhaps it can be re-thought?

list of mmi_payments - totals of the different types of payments
    tuition, meals & lodging, reg fee, app fee, other

import on mmi course - show checkboxes of all current (not ended) D/C/M programs

save deposits - with date/time stamp
deposit choice - file/jive

mark inactive
    make sure date_update is set correctly from registrations
        loadreg seasons going backwards - don't reset
    do this after all is loaded
        keep track of how many are left each time

loadprog -s f02 loadreg -s f02, loadrent -s f02
    can I do this post loadall?
    after each season is loaded do an undup list
        that list should have counts - of numbers of people
            with same name, same addr

unhappy smileys - adrienne, sukhdev, jayanti offerings

rental transmit/convert - error for dups in names

view summary - show coordinator/leader info read only

smaller font for confirmation letter

kaya kalpa on dreg1.html -> scheduler

default date format not mm/dd/yy but Dec 3 '09 or Jan 12 '10???
    easily done.
    Global->init() is a good place.
    or individual choice? :) like color?

what about extra account payments from the past?

D/C/M programs do not go on calendar.  - it would just be noise
    can make an Events for special days in the life of a D/C/M program
        - like orientations, graduations, etc.

mmi payments - gl numbers - figure the nth in the month thing

is it time for a parallel test?

doc!!!!!
    more than a rough testplan

reg, program start/end times = no pm or am
    8 is am
    7 is pm
    elsewhere too?
        in rentals.

if h_type is "Not Needed" don't bother looking
    after a manual reg or edit!

the deposit for a manual registration into an MMI program
    should be transformed into an mmi_payment.

don't check various things in Program if web ready is not set.
do check level

doc:
    MMI Programs:

    For programs offered by Mount Madonna Institute (henceforward MMI)
    the 'sponsoring organization' of the program is not MMC
        it is either:
            MMI College of Ayurvda
            MMI School of Professional Massage
            MMI School of Yoga
            MMI School of Community Studies
    You then need to specify a level:
        Diploma
        Certificate
        Masters
        Course
    If it is not a Course then it is refered to as a DCM program.
    MMI Courses/DCMs are marked with a red star in the list of programs.

    Actually, to see current Personal Retreats and DCMs you must
        choose "PR/DCM" on the list progs page OR
        do a search for a program with a pattern (or season/year).
        These are not normally included because they are
        ever-present (or present for months at a time unlike
        most programs that are typically just a weekend)
        and become a kind of noise.

    MMI Programs, at this time, do not have web pages - and hence
    no on-line registration.  People have to actually _apply_ to
    be a student of the Institute - just like any accredited school.
    Application forms _are_ available at the MMI web site.

    Registrations for a MMI _course_ are facilitated by the "Import"
        link on the course Program page.  You are presented with 
        the DCM programs that are concurrent with the course date range.
        You choose one or more DCM programs and everyone in
        these programs is registered for the course.  The housing
        type choice is assigned individually - based on the most recent
        housing type they were assigned.  If the DCM course is in winter,
        tenting choices are avoided.  Double is the default type.
        The housing type is set but the registrar still needs to go through
        and house everyone individually.

    People can register for only one DCM program at a time.
        Such second registrations are prohibited.  When viewing
        a registration in an MMI _course_ there is a link "To DCM"
        with which you can jump to their DCM registration.

    Tuition for DCM Programs is quite flexible depending on
        their ability to pay.  Various creative discounts for payment
        in full, etc.  So ... we don't really record the tuition _charges_.
        The comment field in the DCM program registration screen
        is used extensively to detail the payment arrangements that
        have been made.

    MMI Payments
        We DO keep close track of the _payments_.  All MMI Payments
        are linked directly to the person not to the registrations.
        On any MMI program registration screen there
        is a section at the bottom named "MMI Payments" with
        links "New" and "List".
        
        Choosing "New" to create a new MMI payment
        you supply a dollar amount, type (credit/check/cash), what the payment
        is for (Tuition/Meals&Lodging/Fees/...) and an optional note.

        For general ledger accounting purposes MMI Programs
        do not really have a single GL number.  Each MMI payment has its _own_
        6 digit GL number which is automatically computed thusly:

            digit 1 - what for (1=Tuition, 2=Meals & Lodging, 3=Application Fee,
                                4=Registration Fee, 5=Other)
            digit 2 - school (1=Ayurveda, 2=Massage, 3=Yoga, 4=Community)
            digit 3 - tens digit of year
            digit 4 - units digit of year
            digit 5 - month (1=Jan, ...  9=Sep, X=Oct, Y=Nov, Z=Dec)
            digit 6 - level (D=Diploma, C=Certificate, M=Masters)

        Each registrant making a payment is enrolled in just one DCM program.
        That DCM program and its _end_ date are used to determine
        digits 2-6 above.  Note that digit 5 could be a letter (X-Z)
        and digit 6 is not a digit (0-9) at all but D, C, or M.

        *Anyone* can register for a MMI _course_ - even people who
        are not enrolled in a DCM program.  These are called "auditors".
        When auditors make a payment (via "New" MMI Payment) 
        the values in digits 2-6 are determined using the MMI _course_ itself.
        Digit 6 is not D, C, or M but it is the _ordinal number_ of the
        course within its month.   e.g. It will be 2 if it is the
        second MMI course within the month of its _end_ date.

        The program where you clicked on the "New" link will
        be remembered with the payment itself.  This means you could
        make a tuition payment on a course registration.  This raises
        the question - are all tuition payments really attached
        to the DCM program?  Auditors would pay a tuition I presume, yes?
        And they have no DCM program.

    List of MMI Payments
        On an MMI program registration there is a link named "List"
        for displaying all of a person's MMI payments.   On the Person
        screen the link is "MMI Payments".

        These fields are listed from the payment records:
            
            amount, description, date, payment type,
            program name, and an optional note.

        You can optionally show the GL number as well, if you wish,
        with the link "Show GL".

        Note that the program where a payment was made
        was not recorded before newReg began to be used.

    Calendar and DailyPic
        DCM Programs (and Personal Retreats) are not shown on the
        calendar (or the daily pic) as they would be annoyingly and
        uselessly ever present.

how to only show current programs in list
    when there are extended programs?
    we could assume extended programs don't have more than a week of
        extension.  use today for edates where extradays = 0
        and today+7 for edates where extradays != 0?
        combined with -and and -or appropriately.

need better indexes - especially now that
    we have much more data - it is good to load
    things up to see where the inefficiencies are.

deposits from manual registrations in a MMI program
    must be routed to mmi_payment, not reg_payment.
for all MMI registrations - be careful of reg_charges.
    m&l but not tuition - and show the m&l charge.

tab order for proposals
    when fields settle down.
    also required fields.
transmit proposal - what gender?
    until it matters - don't worry?
    make a guess?

if CVS is not working and you get an error like
    /usr/local/cvsroot/CVSROOT/config: permission denied
then do this as root:
    echo 0 > /selinux/enforce

proposals 
    ?? summary first on clicking on rental list.
