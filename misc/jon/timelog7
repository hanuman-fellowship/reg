    authorize.net issue
Aug 10 1:00-2:30, 3:30-3:45
    messing around with authorize.net support
        trying to resolve the 'relay' issue.
    the plan is this:
        set a default 'Relay Response URL' to relay_response or somesuch.
            don't have the hosted receipt page at all.
        have a way of easily turning normal online reg to
            "sorry, in maintenance mode".
            but being able to call it anyway.
            maybe with a special unlinked program only.
        relay_response should at the least save the params() in a file
            and have a simple response page.
        ? does using the relay response URL still send an email receipt
            to the user?
        ? will it be called more reliably than the "Silent POST URL"?
