    restore a deleted hybrid rental
        it cascaded - so that is prohibited now
    bad - kali and backups are not happening!
        needs immediate attention.
        bad
        kali is not current.
        make a tar file to set up a new backup machine!
        for the mac as well.
            do a db_init for a clean db
    git pushes the source to newkali okay
        but the database and the perl modules may be disabled!

    docuSign try
    pretty simple.   everyone gets lots of email.
    will need to change who has access to the account
    no images from remote urls
        base64 encoded image inserted in src=""
        cool!
        MMC_header is too big, though.
        can compress, resize
        format must be precise: <img src="data:image/png;base64,...>
        didn't work :(
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47463127/embedded-image-in-htm-document-not-visible-while-signing-in-docusign

        solution:
        print it, save as pdf !!, upload to docusign, add recipient,
            add signature element and date, and send
        add email address to the contract so it is easily seen

        can add multiple users
        as usual it has many more features than we will use
        we'll find our way, document it, and that will be it.
    make MMC_header.png smaller please
