                and it adds a new charge for what you requested
                - add a new type of online payment - For The Balance
                    for these do not add a new charge
                    this should be the *default* type.
            - if online payment request for program that has passed
                don't allow it.   email should say that it has expired.
            - add a link to purge all old unprocessed requests from the list
                auto cron job to do this?
            - general reports - make the desc wider, the zip ranges can wrap

        Deceased should automatically opt-out - yes by being Inactive.
    Jamal says sometimes the change to Report format 6 or 7 does not stick.

    MEMBERSHIP PROJECT
    ==================
    entering a membership payment (in Member area) should
        also automatically enter a payment for the person
        to the Membership extra account (for accounting purposes)
    must be sent by DEADLINE 4/19
    Swapna is leaving for India 4/9 
    Lori will take over during that time.
    members can pay online and the payments come in the usual way
        and are listed like "Online (5)" on the initial membership
        page.   Click on the name and you go to the payment page
        to fill in a few dates, etc - as if you're entering
        it manually.  Can some of those dates be pre-filled?

        the online form could include General ($50) and Sponsor ($600).
        by default they'll be offered their current status.
        they can change that to the other.  perhaps include
        their current total (sponsor) towards a Life membership.
        we could include the date of their last payment and how much.

        We could also have a place there for an extra amount of a 
        payment/donation to an extra account named "Donation--MMC General"?
        Or "Temple" or "The Green Scene" or "Miscellaneous" (not this).

    MAILING LIST UPDATE PROJECT
    ===========================
    Jamal - automatic emailing to everyone with an email address
    to allow them to update their contact info on a web form.  including
    choosing which affiliations they want.  and mailing list prefs.
    security?  a random code that is unguessable.
    the sending of the letters will upload a lot of data (keys are the codes
    and values are the person's info simply encrypted somehow) to
    mountmadonna.org that is referenced when the online form is filled in.
    the data file is in a subdir of cgi-bin

    continuing:

    https on garlic for this
    add email or not to tally by year
    in General Reports - Opt In/Out => MMI/MMC/None
    ask Jamal for an example of the templating
        system that CMS and the email service use
    email - a link https://www.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/list?code=12345trHiJq
        and an action of list_do
    printed - direct them to a form to enter their code
        (just the 6 letters - should be okay), right?
        like: https://www.mountmadonna.org/list or something
        then the action will take them to the filled in form
            with the action for submitting it.
    cron job to get the data - separate from grab_new - still every 15 mins
        with log and report visible from within Reg

    FOR DEVELOPERS
    ==============
    add dispatch, tt, DBIx::Class, adding new table/column
    strings, Perl Best Practices
    my on kali BEFORE push of code

    reg history from logicalpoetry site, email thread

    talked with Barnaby about rental economy+
    add an attribute to a room that is the housing cost level
        that is fixed - not tied to the number of people in the room?
        not sure.  I think it sounds okay.
    when removing a room from a Rental check that no one is
        in that room!  not okay to clobber such a room.
        ask Barnaby if we should always ensure that the local grid
        is current whenever we are about to delete a room....
        every 15 mins, manual grab new on the local grid page itself.
