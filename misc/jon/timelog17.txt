    only account_admin can edit the glnum of programs
    initial glnum for MMI programs is XX
    no mmi monies can be received if glnum contains XX
    next - all future MMI non-standalone courses - put XX in the GL Num.
    so that no one can audit it until Lila does her thing.
    3 digits of course number... in the GL Number.
        there ARE current auditors - what GL Number was used for them???

    getting newkali source git synch'ed and the mysql server running
    with a little help from Ryder and Shantam
    lots of fiddling with the backup and securing new kali for

    puzzling over adjacent rentals for all programs not just PRs 
    understanding rsync for synchronizing online(_done),
        grid, mlist(_done), rides(_done), temple(_done), 
        req_mmi, templates.
    further work on establishing the protocol for the emergency switch
        to vishnu.
        - ensure that the .72 machine is named vishnu
        - rename newkali to vishnu in your /etc/hosts on kali
        - and your local MacBookPro
        - and in the pk script, and in nka, etc.
        - and in the scp commands?  
        - test it!!
        - rsync - but not if on vishnu (-f NEWKALI/VISHNU)
Jul 24 7:45-8:00
    Configuration Counts - useful?  fun at least.
        next - get the counts when doing a synch_db on vishnu
            (use the schema thingy)
        put it in a file, scp it to kali somewhere
Jul 25 12:00-2:00

Aug 3 3:15-3:40, 3:45-4:30,
    adding new table - Organization
        and configuration link to lists, add, edit
    alter event table so there is a foreign key to organization
    when installing I'll need to alter the event table to 
        add column organization_id and write some sql
        update statements to populate it from sponsor

    great progress - including colors for Organizations
        next step: take organization color for MMC, MMI for Programs, Rentals
    name, abbrev for Meeting Places, Organizations - needed or not?
        if so, which to use where?
Aug 6 5:30-6:25, 11:55-12:15
    removing abbrev from organization
    adding note about who to ask for adding an Extra Account
    to install after 'pk':
        % my <mkorg after auto => auto_
        % my - add column organization_id to table event.
            populate the column from sponsor
            drop the sponsor column
        % start server over, make a variety of colors for organizations
        % try the MasterCal hope hope
Aug 7 11:00-12:30
    putting the master calendar code in place - had a case
        I had not tested.   overlap, DateRange issues.
