    only account_admin can edit the glnum of programs
    initial glnum for MMI programs is XX
    no mmi monies can be received if glnum contains XX
    next - all future MMI non-standalone courses - put XX in the GL Num.
    so that no one can audit it until Lila does her thing.
    3 digits of course number... in the GL Number.
        there ARE current auditors - what GL Number was used for them???
