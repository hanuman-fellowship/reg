    only account_admin can edit the glnum of programs
    initial glnum for MMI programs is XX
    no mmi monies can be received if glnum contains XX
    next - all future MMI non-standalone courses - put XX in the GL Num.
    so that no one can audit it until Lila does her thing.
    3 digits of course number... in the GL Number.
        there ARE current auditors - what GL Number was used for them???

    connection problem to mountmadonna.org - called garlic to no avail
    need to do reg.attended_dates with year.
May 19 11:30-1:00
    mountmadonna.org got moved to a new server that was incompatible
    with the Perl modules I had loaded.
    adjusting the Template, AppConfig modules.  Couldn't get the XS stuff
    working for Template. Not sure why.  Reverted to PurePerl.
    called garlic.com again - the time was off.
    still some problem with authorize.net calling 'relay'.
    will need to ask them on Monday.
