    Jamal is now pushing to kali.   I had to mess about with the 'reg' group.
    We need to rethink how to launch.   Not as user sahadev?
    Use Apache or FastCGI or?  Hire someone experienced to help?
    From sf.pm or sv.pm?  The Catalyst fellow?

            both manual and automatic, mmc and mmi.
        need an array with alternating names, numbers
            for the charge_type <select> list.
            perhaps a utility routine?   pass one to be selected?
        i don't know.  getting tired.
    something funky with fname in Controller/Registration.pm
        fname = first name and file name of online file.
        fix this!  understand this!
