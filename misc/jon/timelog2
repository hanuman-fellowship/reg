    Making a nice schema diagram and
    supplying missing relationship methods
    tidying up - using those new methods
    fixing broken Person partnering things - broken
        partly when doing preservation of empty search params.

    canpol required name
    clearer getting of data into hash - and related fixes.

    query Jayanti, Adrienne about new program attributes
        and mailing preferences
Jan 30 12:45-1:40, 2:10-2:50, 3:35-3:50, 6:15-7:45, 9:30-12:00
    dreg1 refactor and include pid, relay => sensing pid and
        outputing to dreg_transactions instead.

    on the Programs page - "Online (3)"
    and then showing the list.

    extracting relevant items from online file and
        putting them in stash for the registration create form.
        finding the person - or creating them.
        new item on reg1.html: new address?
            and disambiguation.
        works pretty well.
        problem with programs with extra days - web site
            dates on page, and on dreg1.html

    registration - got an online registration inserted

    now to delete the one we just inserted and
        to automatically get them
Feb 2 2:55-4:00, 8:20-11:00
    mlist mailings affiliations, fields.
    program - confirmation letter templates,
        start, end times for program and registration

        carpool, hascar (better than the other)
        and \w+_mailings - with cookies, too.
Feb 3 11:40-1:15
    reports and the variety of mailings

    further development on online registration
    got first housing choice the default in housing options
        the list modified by program attributes and housecost of 0.
    person's affils - added to by program affils - create or update.
    person updated - as long as they're unique.
    showing registrations for a program - link to title
        by same akey, first, last initial.
    online, online_done - not in CVS
    
    when continuing - online regs not found - look for possible duplicate
        and ask.
Feb 6 3:15-4:15
    allowing n days before and n days after a program
    as a personal request via a special request in the comment field
    mod to Date::Simple - success
    very tricky.   but done.
Feb 8 4:40-5:30, 5:35-6:15
    adding kids, confnote, work study to initial reg screen

        need to add history, payments, and charges to Registration model
    now to use them.
Feb 11 1:15-2:50, 9:35-10:35
    tweaks to reg_* tables, relationships
    now creating records in reg_history, reg_payment, reg_charge
    need better reg view.
    prognum => id for web templates
    more complete reg view, needs prettying
Feb 12 8:30-9:15, 10:50-11:30
    checking on pid instead of prognum generating regtable
    it's okay now.  including full programs.
Feb 14 1:10-1:25, 1:40-3:00, 5:00-7:15, 7:40-9:30, 10:15-12:50
    email to sponsor members about their membership expiring soon
        or having expired.
    sponsor days optionally used during registration
    better descriptions in Charges
    better navigation around programs/persons/registrations
    paying off balance during blitz registration
        goes to two diff places.
    using 'i' image and overlib!  fun!

    new report format with name linked to view person
    fixing introduced bug in creating/update roles for users.
    input field on program registrations page for searching
        for a particular registrant - in case there are hundreds
        and off screen - make it two part - last name prefix, first name prefix
        can fancy it up later - with ajax - to present the narrowing
        list as you type.
    confirmation letter - mimicking what old reg does now.
Feb 20 5:15-6:00, 9:00-11:30, 12:00-1:20, 3:30-3:50
    ajax enabled narrowing of the registration list
    i think i have all the pieces.
    firefox eventually worked, not Safari - why?
        permission problems - it thinks it is cross-domain
        it isn't :(
    i have polished it pretty highly - color, font, pay/not
        time for a demo to Adrienne and Jayanti
    start on a test plan for registrations
    further refinement and possible further ideas (to ask A, J) for
        the interaction during blitz registration
