    creating registrant with a few columns incl person_id, program_id
        confusing but i did get it correct eventually

    Making a nice schema diagram and
    supplying missing relationship methods
    tidying up - using those new methods
    fixing broken Person partnering things - broken
        partly when doing preservation of empty search params.

    canpol required name
    clearer getting of data into hash - and related fixes.

    query Jayanti, Adrienne about new program attributes
        and mailing preferences
Jan 30 12:45-1:40, 2:10-2:50, 3:35-3:50, 6:15-7:45, 9:30-12:00
    dreg1 refactor and include pid, relay => sensing pid and
        outputing to dreg_transactions instead.

    on the Programs page - "Online (3)"
    and then showing the list.

    extracting relevant items from online file and
        putting them in stash for the registration create form.
        finding the person - or creating them.
        new item on reg1.html: new address?
            and disambiguation.
        works pretty well.
        problem with programs with extra days - web site
            dates on page, and on dreg1.html

    registration - got an online registration inserted

    now to delete the one we just inserted and
        to automatically get them
Feb 2 2:55-4:00, 8:20-11:00
    mlist mailings affiliations, fields.
    program - confirmation letter templates,
        start, end times for program and registration
    worked on dreg[12] and dreg[12].html to enable
        carpool, hascar (better than the other)
        and \w+_mailings - with cookies, too.
Feb 3 11:40-1:15
    reports and the variety of mailings
Feb 5 2:00-3:00, 9:00-11:45
    further development on online registration
    got first housing choice the default in housing options
        the list modified by program attributes and housecost of 0.
    person's affils - added to by program affils - create or update.
    person updated - as long as they're unique.
    showing registrations for a program - link to title
        by same akey, first, last initial.
    online, online_done - not in CVS
    
    when continuing - online regs not found - look for possible duplicate
        and ask.
Feb 6 3:15-4:15
    allowing n days before and n days after a program
    as a personal request via a special request in the comment field
    mod to Date::Simple - success
    very tricky.   but done.

    now to use them.
Feb 11 1:15-2:50, 9:35-10:35
    tweaks to reg_* tables, relationships
    now creating records in reg_history, reg_payment, reg_charge
    need better reg view.
    prognum => id for web templates
    more complete reg view, needs prettying
Feb 12 8:30-9:15, 10:50-11:30
    checking on pid instead of prognum generating regtable
    it's okay now.  including full programs.
Feb 14 1:10-1:25, 1:40-3:00, 5:00-7:15, 7:40-9:30, 10:15-12:50
    email to sponsor members about their membership expiring soon
        or having expired.
    sponsor days optionally used during registration
    better descriptions in Charges
    better navigation around programs/persons/registrations
    paying off balance during blitz registration
        goes to two diff places.

    new report format with name linked to view person
    fixing introduced bug in creating/update roles for users.
    input field on program registrations page for searching
        for a particular registrant - in case there are hundreds
        and off screen - make it two part - last name prefix, first name prefix
        can fancy it up later - with ajax - to present the narrowing
        list as you type.
    confirmation letter - mimicking what old reg does now.
Feb 20 5:15-6:00, 9:00-11:30, 12:00-1:20, 3:30-3:50
    ajax enabled narrowing of the registration list
    i think i have all the pieces.
    firefox eventually worked, not Safari - why?
        permission problems - it thinks it is cross-domain
        it isn't :(
    i have polished it pretty highly - color, font, pay/not
        time for a demo to Adrienne and Jayanti
    start on a test plan for registrations
    further refinement and possible further ideas (to ask A, J) for

Mar 6 10:00-10:45, 4:20-6:00, 11:00-12:10

    began with import all (including past season) of the
        old into the new - to see the completeness of it will be fun
        this will help with scalability issues
        lost connection to mmc :(
    continuing - another goal - unreported genders - with link to

    next is registrations
Mar 16 2:35-3:15, 12:00-1:05
    getting all seasons
        assume 3 years back will not change
    trying to load registrations - many new people to be
        added to people table - because they weren't added
        to the mailing list because they had no addresses.
        how does this happen???? manual registrations?
Mar 21 3:55-
    no substring searching - use a ~ in front instead
