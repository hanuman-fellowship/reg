                    for these do not add a new charge

    MEMBERSHIP PROJECT
    ==================
    entering a membership payment (in Member area) should
        also automatically enter a payment for the person
        to the Membership extra account (for accounting purposes)
    must be sent by DEADLINE 4/19
    Swapna is leaving for India 4/9 
    Lori will take over during that time.
    members can pay online and the payments come in the usual way
        and are listed like "Online (5)" on the initial membership
        page.   Click on the name and you go to the payment page
        to fill in a few dates, etc - as if you're entering
        it manually.  Can some of those dates be pre-filled?

        the online form could include General ($50) and Sponsor ($600).
        by default they'll be offered their current status.
        they can change that to the other.  perhaps include
        their current total (sponsor) towards a Life membership.
        we could include the date of their last payment and how much.

        We could also have a place there for an extra amount of a 
        payment/donation to an extra account named "Donation--MMC General"?
        Or "Temple" or "The Green Scene" or "Miscellaneous" (not this).

    MAILING LIST UPDATE PROJECT
    ===========================
    Jamal - automatic emailing to everyone with an email address
    to allow them to update their contact info on a web form.  including
    choosing which affiliations they want.  and mailing list prefs.
    security?  a random code that is unguessable.
    the sending of the letters will upload a lot of data (keys are the codes
    and values are the person's info simply encrypted somehow) to
    mountmadonna.org that is referenced when the online form is filled in.
    the data file is in a subdir of cgi-bin

    continuing:

    https on garlic for this
    add email or not to tally by year
    in General Reports - Opt In/Out => MMI/MMC/None
    ask Jamal for an example of the templating
        system that CMS and the email service use
    email - a link https://www.mountmadonna.org/cgi-bin/list?code=12345trHiJq
        and an action of list_do
    printed - direct them to a form to enter their code
        (just the 6 letters - should be okay), right?
        like: https://www.mountmadonna.org/list or something
        then the action will take them to the filled in form
            with the action for submitting it.
    cron job to get the data - separate from grab_new - still every 15 mins
        with log and report visible from within Reg

    FOR DEVELOPERS
    ==============
    add dispatch, tt, DBIx::Class, adding new table/column
    strings, Perl Best Practices
    my on kali BEFORE push of code

    reg history from logicalpoetry site, email thread

Jul 15 10:00-10:20, 11:15-12:50
    talked with Barnaby about rental economy+
    add an attribute to a room that is the housing cost level
        that is fixed - not tied to the number of people in the room?
        not sure.  I think it sounds okay.
    when removing a room from a Rental check that no one is
        in that room!  not okay to clobber such a room.
        ask Barnaby if we should always ensure that the local grid
        is current whenever we are about to delete a room....
        every 15 mins, manual grab new on the local grid page itself.
        email sent

        and the display of the SH in the DailyPic
    ## blocks should display like this MM//.
        ## any /'s trailing
        ## if all beds are blocked put BBBBB
    ## cluster view as well
    # add the / to the legend - make it a string like . and |?
    ## block a bed first, then not offered at all - must force
        ## for a reg should be offered with a - O
        ## then the sex of the room changes
        ## a config table sex attribute of B should be equivalent to U
    ## daily pic - special - forest view is clobbered by
        ## awkwardly placed MMS economy dorms.  put the dorms
        ## below forest view lined up
