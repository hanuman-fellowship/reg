    talked with Jamal re MMI Standalone courses appearing
        on the MMC program calendar intermixed with MMC programs.
        still need 'web ready' and 'linked' to be checked.
        the link is the title not leaders, subtitle is below.
        the link goes to the 'web address' field.
        use a different row template for the MMI courses.
        remove the e_progRow.tt2 file - outdated
        rename things - not event calendar - rental calendar
        update the MMI Online help page
        still need to do an MMI Publish.
        Jamal can adjust the <title>, left hand links (Calendar of Events - aka rentals.html)
        a gradient - not on the last one???  optical illusion? no?
        leave the name 'events.html' or change it to 'rentals.html'??
        or make a hard link?
