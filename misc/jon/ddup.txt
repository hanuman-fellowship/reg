Jul 9 3:55-5:20
    beginning on distributed demographic update project (DDUP)
        pro bono?
Jul 10 5:55-8:15
    continuing on DDUP
    finished the generation of the .sql file to insert all chosen
        people's records.
    added listing/dquote_clear as well.
Jul 11 3:40-4:50, 12:45-1:30
    continuing on DDUP
    adding a column 'updated' 1 or empty
    sending the .sql to mountmadonna.com, invoking the CGI script
        to load the data
    append or not, check for errors in gen and loading
    ???what about Sanskrit name????
    ???online form needs careful wording, so does the email & letter we send.
    ???what formats to do opt_inout?
    ???what error checking?   what if someone clears first, last???
    how about the end date?  where to store, where to use it?
    ???report4 - Email To VistaPrint - suffix, title, company comes
        between last and addr1 - so 4 tabs between - not 3
        is it used?
    next is actually getting the changes back to MMC
        two links - one for # of changes
                  - call CGI script to dump to .sql file
                    set all updated to 0
                    get that .sql ascii file
                    apply it to the db.
Jul 12 11:00-1:15
    expiry date for DDUP
    get_updates
    near done?   need to add tel numbers, optin, share statuses
    what else?   recompute akey (on garlic side, please)!  and gender.
        ask about sanskrit
    ???show Jamal that date_updat was changed
    ??? try entering a wrong code
    ??? which affiliations should we offer them to sign up or show
    ???         that they're already signed up?
    ???cgi-bin/u/.... or cgi-bin/update?code=....
    ??? beware - I modified the report\d+.tt2 files
        especially report4 - see above
    ??? end cutoff date for Reports
Jul 12 9:50-10:20, 10:45-1:00
    refining DDUP
    updated => status 0, 1, or 2
    other fields, akey, mailings
    ??? archive the updates.sql files you get - and rename
        them with timestamp
    ???do we need https?  online reg1,2 are not.
    pushed to kali, tested. yay!
    ???another set of links to see the past reports
        for each format
    ???perhaps see all the changes before actually
        making them?
    ???no need for another date of DDUP update - date_updat
        should suffice - can choose a subset based
        on when their record was last updated...
    ???for Addr, Code - a different form
        to enter just the code like www.mountmadonna.org/update
    ???another field with expiry date for each record
        diff status on report/list
        a separate clear function to remove all records
            with an expired expiry date.
Jul 13 9:30-10:30
    showing DDUP to Jamal
Jul 14 12:15-12:30
    analyzing secure_code duplication
        TODO: remove id from secure_codes, check for dups when
            first assigning, two people have empty string for code.
        Add date of last contact to Code reports?
        check data entry for bad data
Jul 15 1:45-3:45
    no id in front of secure code
    online form for entering the 6 letter code
    10 invalid code failures and the system is shut down with
        email sent
    mysql sql counts not in synch with distinct secure_code thingy
        why?   no dups but ???
Jul 17 2:55-3:40, 4:15-5:50
    adding PROGRAM affils to distr demog
    ??? Men's Programs => Men's Issues    ??? ditto Women
        status of 0-3, corresponding update_status
Jul 18 12:20-1:20
    status of 0-3, corresponding update_status

    next: 6 upper case ensure unique from start - delete check_dup, rand6($c)
    then: block ip address if 5 bogus codes, log all failed attempts
    input affils in two columns
    need smaller font?
    less white space at top?  the message on same line as logo?
    jamal?? how to respond?  not just redirect to mmc.org?
    archive the updates.sql coming back?
        on mmc.org as well?
    don't allow another running of CODE until expiry date is over?
        unless append, that is.  and append must have same expiry date?
        ?just make a list of how it could be misused?
Jul 18 1:40-5:20, 9:00-9:50, 12:00-1:00
    secure code 6 upper unique
    jamal?? list of reports - description, zip range - is zip range useful
        what else for second column?  rather two columns?
    all the above things - lots of twiddling!
Jul 19 1:30-4:50
    continuing with DDUP reports, etc.
    talking with Jamal about it all, getting suggestions
    summary:
        ## count without expiry is okay
        ## add country - you forgot it, USA default 
        ## on kali - clean up all country that is US make it blank
            ## verify that new US online regs come in as USA, No cleared in relay.
        ## verify that online reg blank country comes in as blank, yes.
        same edits as in online reg
            not really - for online reg we need at least one phone
            and their address and their gender.  they may not want
            to give us one of those things!   minimum is their
            non-blank first, last.  and a valid email if one was present
            and given.
        ## plain text log of what changed - mostly what fields, prefs+-, affils+-
            ## viewable, clearable via some passworded command
        ## imported 4 of 100, Import Newly Updated Records
        ## fold code to upper case in update so can be entered
            ## on form or in link either way
        ## on form - and hit Return - on the same line
        ## no Clobber listing if no _current_ expiry
        ## Address, Code - with email is okay
        ## past expiry date is not okay
        ## redirect to Programs page - okay
        ask Brajesh, Emily, other, etc.
            I'll be up on Monday to work with them.
            Their opinion is valuable at this point, I think.
        ## Open Gate Sangha affil is not included here
        ## When generating the sql - clear double quotes - it is fast enough.
            ## you could concat and look for " before doing it to make it faster
            ## I did 'index' instead of a regexp.
            ## then eliminate the Clear Double Quote listing
        ask to see the templating mechanism in MailChimp
        ## ? does this need to be done via https SSL?  online reg is not.

    continuing with the things above
    to finish: if $f =~ mailings then just the $P
        other tweaks for logging
    better archive name
    log it all
    validate first, last, email
Jul 21 5:25-6:25
    archiving load and log
