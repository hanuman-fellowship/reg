    redoing affil with mapping table
        trouble - I don't understand the DBIC relationships :(
    it worked by some miracle
Oct 29 6:20-8:50
    getting affils in and out of the form 
    not easy!

    next is the dates.
    lots of notes.  need to consult with S about them all.

Oct 31 12:10-12:30, 6:30-6:40
    began phone list
    joining the affil_people, people tables!  Shankar will have
    the same task.  Yikes!
Nov 4 12:00-12:20
    a bit of progress on the phone list
Nov 5 10:45-11:30
    Laying out steps, milestones, estimates of difficulty.
    Made a beginning.   Mlist might be complete enough - but
    no estimates yet.
Nov 6 6:00-7:15
    dates in people table - using Date::Simple.
    DateTime is So/Too complex, as is Date::Calc.
    not using sort() in person affils view - rather order_by.
Nov 14 9:15-10:45
    working with Shankar
    report table
    KKWC, AW integration in same system
    quitting jobs
Nov 15 6:00-7:00
    fixing up botched housing and 8 bit char
        in a city/country that made trouble
        when sending confirmation letters with
        carpools...
Nov 16 11:20-1:30, 8:30-8:45
    improved date parsing in Date::Simple.pm
        didn't charge for all the time...
    used it in Person.pm
        date validation in update and create forms
        now can use this as a model for reg/program forms.
    restored affil_table - Shankar had started it in the template
    put view in name links and delete and edit on the view page
        seems better

    partners - much easier than i expected!
    for viewing, anyway - and separate was not that hard, either.

    no charge for learning about sessions... which I think
    are needed for partnering up two people.
    authentication - validating who is who - pretty straightforward
        copying.  a one time need and setup so I will put it as billable.
        succeeded up to the User, Role and UserRoles classes loaded.
        then "include authentication and session plugins"
        and the next few items up to starting the server
        and then it failed with:

    Can't call method "can" on an undefined value at
    /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/site/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Authentication/
        Store/DBIC.pm line 98.  Compilation failed in require
        at script/retreatcenter_server.pl line 53.
    need some help with this...
    Found it!
    I put an extra 'e': RetreateCenterDB::User in the yml file.
        very tricky!   it now works! EXcellent.

    fiddling with layout to get the standard links in a better place.

    used the flash mechanism for the status message for deleting, updating
    and then used redirect.   it is better...
    got the name in the status message - even better.
