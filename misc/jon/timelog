Oct 25 12:00-2:45
    people crud with full mlist data
Oct 26 10:45-1:15
    affil crud
    affil on person view, descriptions shown
    links on top for People, Affiliations
Oct 28 8:30-10:00
    redoing affil with mapping table
        trouble - I don't understand the DBIC relationships :(
    it worked by some miracle
Oct 29 6:20-8:50
    getting affils in and out of the form 
    not easy!
    got sex there. also not easy.
    next is the dates.
    lots of notes.  need to consult with S about them all.
Oct 29 8:40-9:50
    getting report data, checking in 
Oct 30 9:30-10:00, 5:30-5:50
    Util.pm with affil_table exported on request.
    3 column with better order
Oct 31 12:10-12:30, 6:30-6:40
    began phone list
    joining the affil_people, people tables!  Shankar will have
    the same task.  Yikes!
Nov 4 12:00-12:20
    a bit of progress on the phone list
Nov 5 10:45-11:30
    Laying out steps, milestones, estimates of difficulty.
    Made a beginning.   Mlist might be complete enough - but
    no estimates yet.
Nov 6 6:00-7:15
    dates in people table - using Date::Simple.
    DateTime is So/Too complex, as is Date::Calc.
    not using sort() in person affils view - rather order_by.
Nov 14 9:15-10:45
    working with Shankar
    report table
    KKWC, AW integration in same system
    quitting jobs
Nov 15 6:00-7:00
    fixing up botched housing and 8 bit char
        in a city/country that made trouble
        when sending confirmation letters with
        carpools...
Nov 16 11:20-1:30, 8:30-8:45
    improved date parsing in Date::Simple.pm
        didn't charge for all the time...
    used it in Person.pm
        date validation in update and create forms
        now can use this as a model for reg/program forms.
    restored affil_table - Shankar had started it in the template
    put view in name links and delete and edit on the view page
        seems better
Nov 17 9:10-11:00, 11:30-12:30
    partners - much easier than i expected!
    for viewing, anyway - and separate was not that hard, either.

    no charge for learning about sessions... which I think
    are needed for partnering up two people.
    authentication - validating who is who - pretty straightforward
        copying.  a one time need and setup so I will put it as billable.
        succeeded up to the User, Role and UserRoles classes loaded.
        then "include authentication and session plugins"
        and the next few items up to starting the server
        and then it failed with:

    Can't call method "can" on an undefined value at
    /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/site/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Authentication/
        Store/DBIC.pm line 98.  Compilation failed in require
        at script/retreatcenter_server.pl line 53.
    need some help with this...
    Found it!
    I put an extra 'e': RetreateCenterDB::User in the yml file.
        very tricky!   it now works! EXcellent.

    fiddling with layout to get the standard links in a better place.

    used the flash mechanism for the status message for deleting, updating
    and then used redirect.   it is better...
    got the name in the status message - even better.
Nov 21 12:00-1:00
    messed around with partnering people
        not easy...  tried sessions, it was awkward.
        typing first, last name - must match just once.
Nov 21 6:00-6:50, 9:50-10:45
    asking to create new partner or not - if yes, copy info.
    akey after create or update of address fields

    asking to copy addr, home phone to new existing partner
    js alert for deletes, separates and partnering
Nov 23 2:15-3:30, 10:00-10:15
    unpartner the partner when deleting
    look for and warn about duplicates
    CSS float and clear positioning of view and create people pages
Nov 28 12:00-1:30
    a breakthrough - by abandoning (or extending) DBIx::Class
    phone list is almost done
Dec 5 12:00-12:30, 6:50-7:10, 7:35-10:35
    tweaks on the phone list
    taking over reports - zip parser, run.
    pretty good progress - some tricky sql
    next - count format and random set of certain size
Dec 6 1:15-3:25
    no_mail column instead of an affiliation
    partners get one mailing not two - not easy!
Dec 7 9:15-10:40, 11:50-1:30
    nrecs in reports - random subset
        that was fun - and quick.
        i certainly am using the abundance of memory and processor speed!
    fixing various things at the center
        sutra mailing
        regi finances
        cost of housing columns
        demonstrating, getting feedback from what I did.

    sutra mailings talking to SVI about mail.
    fixing housing costs - 1-5, 6-8
    hope it works!    This hour was not on the rewrite project.
    Same tally?
Dec 11 9:15-9:45, 10:15-12:45, 2:00-3:00, 11:00-11:15
    removing stale addresses in sutra

    New Listings:
        Email to VistaPrint 
        Email addresses
        Undup list
            all create a file that you can download

    At center - showing, fixing (edits to a partner), asking.

    mlist test plan - further additions

    then leader.
Dec 15 9:30-10:00, 12:15-2:50, 3:25-4:45, 5:15-9:20

        in create/update
            glnum generation with javascript
                on change of from date.
            and to date = from + 2

    alternative view sort by date???

    vistaprint format for couples
    housing costs crud
    cancellation policy crud
    enough!  did a lot!
Dec 16 1:15-3:05, 3:20-4:00
    Authorization - it works!
    Conditioned the links in several places in the views
        for create, delete, edit - as admin role.
    ACL Authorization as well...
    program, housecost, affil and canpol
        are all protected - must be an admin to modify them.
    very very nice work on their part.  and well documented.
Dec 17 12:30-3:25, 5:00-6:50

    new table for rentals, no type in programs
    begin on gen
    clobbered Util, need access to get back.
    checking in
    figured out that I can add the gen Program methods
        directly to the lib/RetreatCenterDB/Program.pm file.
        THAT file IS the program table class.
    sort programs by date
    getting tired.   will do cost of housing tomorrow.
        good progress!
Dec 22 11:00-12:30
    housing glitch - not easy!
    email + name listing in reg1
    pattern in comment search listing
    email, current address now gets into mlist when
        registering online.
Dec 27 11:40-12:30
    upload an image for leader
    tricky getting the pathnames right
    how to do an update/delete of the image?
    look at vegweb??
Dec 29 4:20-5:50, 10:10-12:00
    major tweaks on image uploads for leaders, programs
    templates - list, upload, delete, use them from publish
        pick from restricted list in Programs

    it all works!
    now I can continue with publishing.
    mail links, stale
    configuring ssh to Shankar's machine
    trying to debug the session problem - to no avail.
Jan 4 1:00-2:00, 2:35-4:15, 4:55-7:40, 8:50-11:00
    gathering tags, more generation
    not easy to translate it direct...
    perhaps I should have generated text files?
    it's going okay.
    even got exceptions to work!
    exceptions - multiline
    picture - larger popup is always there.
    fee table
Jan 5 12:50-2:40, 3:15-4:25, 4:50-5:20
    keep originals, resize on altering imgwidth
    must login on restart - to reinitialize Lookup.
    finished generation - including regtable
        fees consolidated
    only future programs, rentals
    ftp to mountmadonna.org/staging

    members
    something is not working - take a break, compare to leaders.
    adjust horizontal alignment
    insert a member at the first
    forgot category - C needs better error messages!
    lapsed updating
    checked in.   pretty good!

    roles - one implies another
    referential integrity issues
        not easy but important!
Jan 11 2:30-3:30, 11:20-12:00
    retrieving misplaced online reg's
    further ref integ instances
    sitting watching 
Jan 12 12:20-4:20, 10:45-12:05
    sponsor payment history, membership list
    got really confused with DBIx - assigned the
    result of a search to a scalar and it never executed.
    and no error even if I misspelled the DB Class name. :(
    later - brochure generation
Jan 14 4:00-6:50
    fine tuning Member update dialog
    partners becoming Life members - very tricky!
    this is not for reg - so does not count towards the
    do-not-exceed.
Jan 14 8:15-10:15, 11:00-12:00
    required fields
    _get_data(), %hash, @mess more consistently
