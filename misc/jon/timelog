    Laying out steps, milestones, estimates of difficulty.
    Made a beginning.   Mlist might be complete enough - but
    no estimates yet.

    dates in people table - using Date::Simple.
    DateTime is So/Too complex, as is Date::Calc.
    not using sort() in person affils view - rather order_by.
