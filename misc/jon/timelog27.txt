        work with an audience!) but ...
        adding badge_title column to program and rental
        placed Global->init in Root->index
        John understood and suggested
            a code review post development
            complement him on his compassion and experience
                in this regard.
            ask about text field default in mysql.
                version 5.0.95 (on kali) vs 5.7.21 (on cloudkali)
            ask about creating more indexes!!
                for speed.
    reworked the call to gen_badges
    rental badges - nifty!
    fixed DBH.pm on cloudkali

    normalize rental names in badges
    have smaller font for long names in badges
    show Aja name wrapping to second line, smaller font
        also badge_title
            some rentals have no title at all...
                Count On Us, for example
        tweak margins
    title length, missing code

    install Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
        it generates .xls files - can be opened with OSX Numbers
    reconcile spreadsheet - freeze panes???
    period end spreadsheet - almost
Apr 21 9:30-11:00, 8:30-9:15
    a lot of fiddling
    OSX Numbers does not respect freeze_panes for some reason
    Google Sheets does :)
    used xl_rowcol_to_cell for =SUM()
    TODO: add legend for r rental and x extra account
          add r, x to name column   like BADGE - r or TEMPLE - x
          and also the 'As of' current date
            which you can move above the legend in Reg screen
          larger font overall
Apr 22 7:50-9:15
    remove gridlines
    _init_worksheet sub to not repeat initializations of formats
        lame?  but clearer?
    clear old images and spreadsheets on login in a better way
