    pairing with John (disaster - can't really
        work with an audience!) but ...
        adding badge_title column to program and rental
        placed Global->init in Root->index
        John understood and suggested
            a code review post development
            complement him on his compassion and experience
                in this regard.
            ask about text field default in mysql.
                version 5.0.95 (on kali) vs 5.7.21 (on cloudkali)
            ask about creating more indexes!!
                for speed.

    normalize rental names in badges
    have smaller font for long names in badges
    show Aja name wrapping to second line, smaller font
        also badge_title
            some rentals have no title at all...
                Count On Us, for example
        tweak margins
    title length, missing code
