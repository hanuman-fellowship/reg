    pairing with John (disaster - can't really
        work with an audience!) but ...
        adding badge_title column to program and rental
        placed Global->init in Root->index
        John understood and suggested
            a code review post development
            complement him on his compassion and experience
                in this regard.
            ask about text field default in mysql.
                version 5.0.95 (on kali) vs 5.7.21 (on cloudkali)
            ask about creating more indexes!!
                for speed.
    reworked the call to gen_badges
    rental badges - nifty!
    fixed DBH.pm on cloudkali
Apr 3 5:15-6:00, 12:10-12:40
    normalize rental names in badges
    have smaller font for long names in badges
    show Aja name wrapping to second line, smaller font
        also badge_title
            some rentals have no title at all...
                Count On Us, for example
        tweak margins
    title length, missing code

    install Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
        it generates .xls files - can be opened with OSX Numbers
    reconcile spreadsheet - freeze panes???
    period end spreadsheet - almost
Apr 21 9:30-11:00, 8:30-9:15
    a lot of fiddling
    OSX Numbers does not respect freeze_panes for some reason
    Google Sheets does :)
    used xl_rowcol_to_cell for =SUM()
    TODO: add legend for r rental and x extra account
          add r, x to name column   like BADGE - r or TEMPLE - x
          and also the 'As of' current date
            which you can move above the legend in Reg screen
          larger font overall

    remove gridlines
    _init_worksheet sub to not repeat initializations of formats
        lame?  but clearer?

    TODO:
        examine member benefits
            - reset_mem seems to not work right
            - depends on NightHist being correct
            after a delete or vacate or cancel
                of a registration where they used benefits
                or even after a _compute

    from 20200816 through 20201101 there are TRIPLICATE
        config record entries.  why?
    from 20201102 there are DOUBLED entries up to 20210329
    then single again
    why is last_config_date 20201101 but config table goes to 20230730?
    perhaps someone added a program or rental far in
        the future and the adding of config records took took long
        and they didn't want to wait for the browser to return
        so they abandoned the request in the middle of
        the config records being added?  and the last_config_date
        was not properly set.  Likely.  or the browser timed out?

        can we add them in the background - they still may
            not wait long enough.
        or add them far in the future with an independent
            process rather than on demand?

Apr 28 7:55-8:00
    how about a cron job on the 1st to add a month more
        and keep config 3 years ahead.
    AND the same cron job can clear unused config records
        in the past (say 3 months back).
        Is that okay?  Will we still be
        able to see who was where and still generate the
        correct DailyPic for past dates?
Apr 29 1:50-3:40, 11:15-12:00
    config rework - 
        can we add a constraint so that house_id + the_date is unique
            otherwise throw error?
            that _pair_ IS the unique id
    58, 62, 87, 178 - 2 < 1?
        can we change the size in config, too???
            maybe? maybe not.
    seems to work to delete past config records where cur = 0
        how far back?  a month.
        what if tried to house someone/rental booking
            in the past?  can prohibit.
    fixconfig worked to take away dups
    the cron job has to ask for the max the_date in config.
        it is fast.
    last_config_date in string is way off - 2020? 2023?
    truncate it to 4 years ahead.

    on kali - ran fixconfig, cleared cur = 0 before March 31, 2017.
    truncated config - ends at 20220501, set sys_last_config_date.

    TODO:
    need to not do add_config when adding program, rental, event
        or blocks?
    need to prohibit adding such when edate exceeds last config record.
    need monthly cronjob to extend config by a month
        same job will clear cur = 0 records up to today minus 1 month
    prohibit changing housing in the past.
        not tt_today timetravel...

    confirmation letter rewrite - much cleaner!!
        is it complete enough?

    I like "Please read on to prepare for your stay on our beautiful mountain!"
    gate code - okay after Arrivals?
    registration start/end time - can be different
        old letter specified both start/end
        new one just 4:00 - okay?
    no program start/end times in new
    no checkOUT time...
    trail/mmc maps in separate section Maps
        same as in old letter... but pdf instead of jpg
        pdf is sharper than jpg for maps
            is it okay that the Main_Area one is so large?
                1.1 meg
    What if there's a confirmation note???? - I added it at the bottom
        (above carpool)
        in a section called 'Notes'. Okay?
    Program note, too.
        as long as they're not empty, that is.
    Ariana's meal website???
    Carpool list?
        added after signature
    Lots of special cases are not handled.
    e.g. PR on Sunday
        okay.   It references Maps - no more, right?
    Deposit received instead of Payment - okay?
        otherwise I will need to total up payments...
    The old conf letter had an 'invoice'.
        a complete description of charges, payments, and balance
        not needed any more?
    No Kaya Kalpa info - people could request massage appt.
    LOTS of no PRs!
        the first reg page has a long list
    refund if first choice not avail...
    program begin/end times?
    no DO NOT - will people not read the warnings
        about prohibited substances?
    no word about snorers...
    MMI
    This will evolve over time just like the current one did...
    Carpool list?
    The official individual Cancellation Policy is on the registration page.
        No need to put in the confirmation letter?
        If OGS is different will there be a problem that
        the confirmation letter points to the standard one?
        
        The old conf letter did spell out the cancellation policy.
        Should this one?
    no after hours emergency phone
    no current date at the top.   - just the
        Date on the email should suffice ...
    receipt #? does anyone care?

        when first finalizing the registration
    create a pre payment request only if the template
        has a tag of pre_payment_link
    if the cancellation policy is non-standard
        include it in the conf letter.
    does this also work for MMI programs?
    MMI imported registrations are a different matter, yes?
    why won't it do the ftp?
May 3 3:45-5:00
    ftp issues???  it's okay on kali.
