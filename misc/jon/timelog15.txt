    for MMI
    online payments
    Thinking out loud here about what would be required:
    Creating the request in Reg - and sending the email to the
    student with a link to click to bring them (by some more magic)
    to the form that is already filled in with their demographic information
    and the payment amount and what it is for and the program it is destined
    for where all they have to do is put in their credit card number
    (and expiration date).
    Then that form is processed and another 'relay' program
    takes that info and prepares a file for Reg to grab
    and import into the right place in the student's MMI registration.
    You'd be able to see a list of MMI payment requests that
    have not yet been paid.   I could send you an email
    whenever a payment was grabbed to alert you, if you wished.

    It will take some doing.
    An estimate of 8-10 hours is probably reasonable.
    That's $400-$500 at $50 an hour.
    Let's say I could finish it by the second week in January.
