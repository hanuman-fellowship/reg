    PROGRAM CANCELLATION PROJECT
    ============================
    Use the program id for the name of the program's web .hmtl page
        instead of crafting it from pname.
    Cancelling a program - add an attribute that is set with a
        menu link (not a form input element) after confirmation.
        Can't cancel if any registrations are present.
    On the program list mark cancelled programs differently.
    Don't include them in the list of programs to register for.
    Cancelled programs still have web pages - perhaps you
        choose a different template.
        But these are not 'linked'.  still live in the staging/
        or live/ dir.  Can't register for them - the template
        could/should omit the 'Register Now' links.
        If they are included don't let the registration proceed.

    MEMBERSHIP PROJECT
    ==================
    entering a membership payment (in Member area) should
        also automatically enter a payment for the person
        to the Membership extra account (for accounting purposes)
    must be sent by DEADLINE 4/19
    Swapna is leaving for India 4/9 
    Lori will take over during that time.
    members can pay online and the payments come in the usual way
        and are listed like "Online (5)" on the initial membership
        page.   Click on the name and you go to the payment page
        to fill in a few dates, etc - as if you're entering
        it manually.  Can some of those dates be pre-filled?

        the online form could include General ($50) and Sponsor ($600).
        by default they'll be offered their current status.
        they can change that to the other.  perhaps include
        their current total (sponsor) towards a Life membership.
        we could include the date of their last payment and how much.

        We could also have a place there for an extra amount of a 
        payment/donation to an extra account named "Donation--MMC General"?
        Or "Temple" or "The Green Scene" or "Miscellaneous" (not this).

    MAILING LIST UPDATE PROJECT
    ===========================
    Jamal - automatic emailing to everyone with an email address
    to allow them to update their contact info on a web form.  including
    choosing which affiliations they want.  and mailing list prefs.
    security?  a random code that is unguessable.
    the sending of the letters will upload a lot of data (keys are the codes
    and values are the person's info simply encrypted somehow) to
    mountmadonna.org that is referenced when the online form is filled in.
    the data file is in a subdir of cgi-bin

    FOR DEVELOPERS
    ==============
    add dispatch, tt, DBIx::Class, adding new table/column
    strings, Perl Best Practices

    reg history from logicalpoetry site, email thread
