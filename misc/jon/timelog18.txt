    PROGRAM CANCELLATION PROJECT
    ============================
    Use the program id for the name of the program's web .hmtl page
        instead of crafting it from pname.
    Cancelling a program - add an attribute that is set with a
        menu link (not a form input element) after confirmation.
        Can't cancel if any registrations or bookings are present.
    On the program list mark cancelled programs differently.
    Don't include them in the list of programs to register for.
    Cancelled programs still have web pages - perhaps you
        choose a different template - no.
        These are not 'linked'.  Still live in the staging/
        or live/ dir.  Can't register for them - the template
        could/should omit the 'Register Now' links.
        It uses the standard default.html template and
        replaces the Register Now links with a Registration Closed image.
        The registration_closed.html template was removed.
        Also template.html was removed - obsolete.
        No easy way to register for these programs - only by concocting
        a URL or messing with the address bar in Reg.
        Such pages do not have navigation to next/prev prog/month. Okay?
        They are there simply to provide a landing page for
        the links that may have been sent out.   The change of name to
        the unique id could be taken care of by 
        a link in the dir until we get beyond this point.
        On the Reg calendar we have Cancelled programs (on the
        top in red since no Meeting Place).  Their popup has
        Cancelled in red.  The details row has Cancelled in red
        after the name.
    I put a green w in the status column to denote programs
    that are Web Ready.   Okay or too cryptic?  What else?
    I think it is useful.   Can omit MMI and then scan down
    the list to make sure that all are either PRs or with a w until
    the next season comes.

    No cancelled programs in DailyPic or ClusterView.

    MEMBERSHIP PROJECT
    ==================
    entering a membership payment (in Member area) should
        also automatically enter a payment for the person
        to the Membership extra account (for accounting purposes)
    must be sent by DEADLINE 4/19
    Swapna is leaving for India 4/9 
    Lori will take over during that time.
    members can pay online and the payments come in the usual way
        and are listed like "Online (5)" on the initial membership
        page.   Click on the name and you go to the payment page
        to fill in a few dates, etc - as if you're entering
        it manually.  Can some of those dates be pre-filled?

        the online form could include General ($50) and Sponsor ($600).
        by default they'll be offered their current status.
        they can change that to the other.  perhaps include
        their current total (sponsor) towards a Life membership.
        we could include the date of their last payment and how much.

        We could also have a place there for an extra amount of a 
        payment/donation to an extra account named "Donation--MMC General"?
        Or "Temple" or "The Green Scene" or "Miscellaneous" (not this).

    MAILING LIST UPDATE PROJECT
    ===========================
    Jamal - automatic emailing to everyone with an email address
    to allow them to update their contact info on a web form.  including
    choosing which affiliations they want.  and mailing list prefs.
    security?  a random code that is unguessable.
    the sending of the letters will upload a lot of data (keys are the codes
    and values are the person's info simply encrypted somehow) to
    mountmadonna.org that is referenced when the online form is filled in.
    the data file is in a subdir of cgi-bin

    FOR DEVELOPERS
    ==============
    add dispatch, tt, DBIx::Class, adding new table/column
    strings, Perl Best Practices

    reg history from logicalpoetry site, email thread

Apr 4 11:30-12:30
    affirm that everyone's expiration date is 12/31, right?
    what if someone first pays in November or July? - manually adjust
    to following year?  where is boundary?

    formatting letters for new way - online payment form
        both with and without email present

    7 letters in all - times 2 for email or not
        so 14 cases to test.  Shantam to test, please?
        Lori, Shantam to work together if Swapna has left for India.
        letters 3-7 test TO YOU and to the member's email.

    1 - ack_gen - After payment - either create anew or another payment
    2 - ack_spons
        
    -- done --

    3 - lapse - Lapse, Lapse + Inactive = lapsed()

    4 - gen_exp - Expire 12/31 = just_expired()
    5 - spons_exp

    6 - lapse_gen_soon - Lapse Soon = lapse_soon()
    7 - lapse_spons_soon
Apr 7 11:40-4:00, 6:50-
    cancelled programs done right

    to push to kali:
    add the field secure_code to table people default ''
        and run fix_sec_code in /mig.
    add the field cancelled to table program text not null default ''
    tweaks to remedy all the changes

    membership
        defaults of t ^2, 12/31 ^3 Right?
    added payment type credit, check, cash
    automatic payment to Membership xaccount
    condition in ack_gen letter on new member or not
        who keeps track of which general members can
            vote and which cannot? :)
            another flag on membership record?
    Members w/$   and Members   lists only members that are
                                not lapsed or inactive
        can see all incl Inactive by entering * in search box
    screwy - can change Inactive to General without entering
        an amount and they are automatically not lapsed any more
        because of the default 12/31 of this year....
