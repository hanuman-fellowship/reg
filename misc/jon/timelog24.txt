        max # of people derived from web grid.
        updated by grab_new when new grid is gotten.
        balance is recomputed and updated as well.
        balance is recomputed when payments, charges are added.
        before - only the invoice display did it.
    Lots of work - went fairly smoothly - just put 4 hours
    Now have invoice.tt2 template - much better

        many old ones won't have a CODE-data.txt file? then - 0 0 0 0
        that script can't rely on DB Rental compute_balance
