	add new attributes to program page - will make pretty later
	dumping out all values including housing costs
	generating all program-unique items on the pages
		including picture and month calendar

	on my own time - made the program screen look pretty

	Housing command - show and clear - to see clusters and rooms
		likely not used much if at all!   moved from main menu
		to have more screen real estate available.
Apr 7 10:00-10:10, 11:30-11:50, 12:30-1:05, 1:15-5:35, 6:15-6:25

	some problem with next/prev month

	making /usr/local/bin/genpages
		to invoke gen and to ftp the pages
Apr 9 9:35-10:20, 10:40-11:00
	invoking genpages properly and redirecting the error and debug output
	it works!

	adjusted Program menu, testing.
	added prognum into reg1 invoking of online reg.
		doesn't work yet since new format of regtable
Apr 10 11:30-12:30, 1:15-4:00
	on Jayanti's suggestion - adding Linked? and Template
		to program attributes.    
	implemented them in the generation program

	next is to get reg[1-3] working again
		have regtemp.html and regcheck.html in the cgi-bin/mmc dir

	did it well... housing table looks GREAT.
Apr 11 7:00-7:10, 9:50-10:30
	verifying that the images for web/leader are
		present in the pics/ subdir.
	javascript form validation
		learning about it on my own time
	restructuring the registration form preparing it for
		the javascript validation and adding
		the field Gyan mentioned - a checkbox for receiving mailings
			default checked??  and they have to UNcheck it?
Apr 12 2:20-2:45
	further tweaks on the form
Apr 13 8:00-8:45, 2:50-5:30
	redoing the fee_table to accomodate economy at retreats
	implementing javascript validation ala the fancy way
Apr 14 10:45-12:00
	on own time - redid the p_get routine so it's easier
	to see which field you're in.   mostly cosmetic and
	tedious - so no charge.

	added checkbox for inclusion on occasional mailings.
		is the wording okay?
	reg2 - send cookies.  also verify that reg1 reads them

	***
	the various templates and forms need beautification attention
		from the graphic and marketing people.
	sizes, fonts, colors, backgrounds, logos, etc.
	***

	reg2 - server side checks, making cookies work with CGI.
Apr 16 1:00-1:30, 1:45-3:30, 3:45-3:55, 4:15-5:20
	cookies in reg1 and reg2 - escaped and unescaped
		could not get CGI cookie methods to work :(
	tidying up authorize.net fields
	variable deposit - it works!
Apr 19 3:00-4:00
	add Couple radio button to reg1.html and a 
		"staying with whom?" text field.
Apr 20 9:25-11:50
	desc field in reg is really a 3 part field:
	desc, subdesc and barnacles (**+%)
		desc is separated from subdesc by a dash
		any non-alphanumeric at the end are the barnacles
	new methods: title, subtitle, barnacles, fulldesc_plus
		if there are leaders
			title is leaders 
			if subdesc
				subtitle is desc - subdesc
			else
				subtitle is desc
			fi
		else
			title is desc
			subtitle is subdesc
		fi
		title and subtitle can be styled differently

		still have methods for desc, subdesc, leaders
		fulldesc_plus is fulldesc appended with
			the strings looked up (in a table of some sort)
			with each barnacle.  perhaps hdesc.txt and this
			table can be merged
	need to begin a document describing all this.
		the web is a good place to keep it.
		also store scripts, etc there for safekeeping

	prog table has several mods that need to be propogated
		desc, note1, note2 are now 75 chars long
		additional fields at the end
		compare dev to prod and make sure
	later: the brochure generation
		barnacles are dealt with differently there.

	making a little CGI script on garlic for switching
		staging to programs and back
			for testing we'll call it 'live' instead of 'programs'
		lots of trouble!    cacheing in Safari and 
		permissions on garlic - mmcweb vs webserve users
			made staging and live dirs 777.
			security risk?

	programs that have no leaders and no subdescription will look funny
		title:        with nothing after the title.
Apr 22 3:30-5:15, 12:45-1:00
	rentals - making fields for the calendar of events
	dumping them out
	making Rental.pm for the methods to access them
	starting the generating of the calendar of events and programs
		nice polymorphism!
Apr 24 3:50-5:00
	generating eventindex, progindex
	too slow of a response from intranet.mountmadonna.org
		move it back local?
		yes
	eliminating calxxx.tmpl and replacing it with CSS classes
		more control!
	generating event and program calendars
		attempted first to not use templates, then used them
		spent a good bit longer than i put down for my experimentation
Apr 25 12:50-1:30
	inserting event and program lists into the templates
