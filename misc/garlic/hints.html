In a name field of the Housing Assignment Grid if you put:
<ul>
    Charles Jones & Mary Smith
</ul>
(names separated by an ampersand '&')
this means that there are two people in the space (usually a tent)
and that they both should be charged the normal cost.
<p>
If you put:
<ul>
    Mark Bronson & Aaron child<br>
</ul>
or
<ul>
    Greta Haroldson & Annie child & Bobby child
</ul>
(a name followed by the word 'child')
then the children will be charged half of the normal cost.
Children are defined to be age 12 or under.
<p>
The above cases will be highlighted <span class=special>in red</span>
when the grid is displayed with costs.
<p>
The names of houses with a fixed cost will be shown in <span style="color: green">green</span>.
