Q: I do sadhana, feel unattached, then go to work and get
completely caught up in a drama.

A: Right, because in the next moment the aim is forgotten,
and the mind becomes attached and expects some kind of
recognition.

Q: I need a little watch with a pin prick.

A: Mind is the best watch, if you keep it ticking.
