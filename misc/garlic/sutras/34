Q: When I am about to have a negative thought about someone,
is there anything I can do to stop that thought?

A: The mind enjoys its negativities because there is
violence. The mind, by nature, goes toward violence. If
negativity starts and you identify it as violence, then you
can stop it.                  - Gateways, May '88
