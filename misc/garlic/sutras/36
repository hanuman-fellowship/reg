Q: What are ways to help us become aware of the "unreality"
of the world?

A: If we see a tree, it is a "real" perception because it is
seen, it is felt, and we can attain a knowledge of its
existence.  Our mind is attached to one thing.  That thing
changed a long time ago, but due to our attachment, we don't
see the change.  - Gateways, Nov. '88
