Q: How does Babaji feel about the sense of humor on the
spiritual path?

A: On the spiritual path, people think you  have to sit
sadly and be serious all the time, thinking about God.  When
a person's mind is purified, the mind develops happiness. 
In that state of happiness, the mind becomes playful. 

(Apr 92)
