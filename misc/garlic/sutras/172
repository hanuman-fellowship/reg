Q: If everything is determined by samskaras, what is the
role of free will? Can one ask for what one wants, or is it
better to surrender to the unfolding of God's will?

A: Samskaras are like seeds in a bottle.  If put in soil,
only those that get favorable conditions will germinate.  To
put in favorable soil is in our hands (free will).
