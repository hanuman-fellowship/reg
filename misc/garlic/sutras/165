Q: Is it appropriate for Westerners to focus on death and
dying as a method of learning dispassion toward the body?

A: Death creates dispassion in any person in any country. 
It's a reality of life which is seen.  We struggle for our
whole lives for possessions, for pleasure, and for
self-gratification.  And then what do we see?  A person is
dead.
