Q: There is so much injustice in the world...how does one
choose a cause and go after it, ..or.. is there any way to
affect it all at once?

A: No one could solve all the problems, so we first have to
start at our own place.  (home, town, country, etc.) So we
can't expect universal peace, although it is a noble
thought.
