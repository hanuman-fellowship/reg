These files from mountmadonnainstitute.org are subtly different from
the ones on mountmadonna.org.   I didn't have the energy to
deal with the differences today so I just checked in the second near copy.
If you'd like to merge them and made things conditional you are welcome.
This DOES increase the maintenance costs for online reg.
Let's hope not many changes are needed.
