[09:12am] jonbjornstad: Question...  Is there a way to get control at Catalyst server start up time?  I want to do some initializations.  I would need a $c - Catalyst context to do the inits.
[09:12am] mst: step back. explain what you're trying to achieve.
[09:12am] jonbjornstad: okay.  thank you for being here.
[09:13am] jonbjornstad: I'm using the fabulous DBIx::Class for database ORM access.    Some tables hardly change at all and are frequently used.  I'd like to read their contents into globally accessible variables at start up time.
[09:14am] jshirley: jonbjornstad++ # best response to /achieve ever.
[09:15am] mst: jonbjornstad: there is no $c outside of requests
[09:15am] mst: however
[09:15am] mst: seems to me like that's not what you want anyway
[09:15am] jonbjornstad: okay.
[09:15am] • mst thinks
[09:15am] lordarthas joined the chat room.
[09:16am] mst: jonbjornstad: do you just need to get an array of values
[09:16am] mst: or lookup-by-PK as well?
[09:17am] mst: either way, it seems to me your DBIC $schema should do this on ->connect
[09:17am] charsba__ left the chat room. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[09:17am] mst: that's how I've done it for @clients before now
[09:18am] jonbjornstad: just an array of values - no particular PK
[09:18am] jonbjornstad: how do I get control at DBIC connect time?
[09:19am] mst: sub connect {
[09:19am] charsbar joined the chat room.
[09:20am] jonbjornstad: that is a function in the DBIx::Class package??
[09:20am] mst: no
[09:20am] mst: it's a DBIx::Class::Schema method
[09:21am] mst: please learn DBIx::Class before trying to hack it 
[09:21am] jonbjornstad: of course!
[09:21am] jonbjornstad: that's why I'm asking the expert!
[09:21am] mst: alright, but this is as fundamental as DBI->connect
[09:21am] mst: you shouldn't need telling
[09:21am] mst: you also shouldn't call methods functions 
[09:22am] jonbjornstad: okay so I add a method to DBIx::Class::Schema called connect() and there I can do my inits?

[09:23am] mst: jonbjornstad: do you understand what subclassing is?
[09:23am] jonbjornstad: yes
[09:23am] mst: you have a MyApp::Schema or similar that does "use base qw(DBIx::Class::Schema);"
[09:23am] mst: right?
[09:23am] purl: i heard right was wrong. or more likely to not have problems with torturing people
[09:23am] jonbjornstad: yes
[09:23am] mst: so you can add the method there 
[09:23am] jonbjornstad: okay.
[09:24am] mst: if this isn't obvious, I suspect you're treating DBIC as magic
[09:24am] mst: it's not. it's a bunch of classes that co-operate together. it's still just perl.
[09:24am] mst: it just happens to be Sufficiently Advanced Technology when you first encounter it 
[09:24am] lordarthas left the chat room. (Ping timeout: 360 seconds)
[09:25am] jonbjornstad: it DOES take a bit of learning to use it effectively.
[09:25am] jonbjornstad: i have been able to use it in a rather complex environment (44 tables) without understanding it deeply.
[09:25am] jonbjornstad: that is a testament to its quality!
[09:26am] mst: actually, it's probably a testament to the documentation
[09:26am] mst: castaway++ # and everybody who helped her
[09:26am] jonbjornstad: kudos to all!
[09:26am] Nom: Anyone here per chance worked with one of those network appliance builders before?  Where you drag and drop servers, and hit deploy and it builds and configures all your network appliances?

[09:33am] nigel left the chat room. (Quit: nigel)
[09:33am] jonbjornstad: i have a MyAppDB.pm which subclasses DBIx::Class::Schema and does a load_classes().  How do I get a $schema so that I can do my initializations?
[09:34am] mst: did you look at the docs for connect() ?
[09:34am] jonbjornstad: The connect(dsn, ...) happens elsewhere, right?
[09:34am] mst: yes, it's called elsewhere
[09:34am] mst: it could be called from many elsewheres
[09:34am] mst: that's -why- you want to wrap that
[09:35am] jonbjornstad: (did I just make up a word elsewhere?  )
[09:36am] jonbjornstad: I see the doc for connect() but it doesn't enlighten me further.
[09:37am] mst: my $schema = My::Schema->connect;
[09:37am] mst: right?
[09:37am] purl: i think right is wrong. or more likely to not have problems with torturing people
[09:38am] Nom: incompatible encoding
[09:39am] jonbjornstad: and in My::Schema connect() I call the base class connect() to actually do the connection to the DB?
[09:39am] mst: right.
[09:39am] mst: sub connect { my $new = shift->next::method(@_); <populate pre-cache here>; return $new; }

[09:48am] jonbjornstad: do I do this?:  sub connect { my $schema = shift->SUPER::connect(@_);  <populate pre-cache with $schema->resultset('DVD')->search(...); return $schema }
[09:49am] confound: mst's "next::method" was a literal, not an example
[09:50am] jonbjornstad: really?

[09:50am] rjbs: really.
[09:50am] confound: perldoc Class::C3
[09:50am] jonbjornstad: okay 
[09:51am] jonbjornstad: and the $new above is used as the $schema?
[09:51am] t0m: yes
[09:51am] AndyA joined the chat room.
[09:51am] jonbjornstad: phew!  okay!  I have learned many things.  Thank you.    Now to try this!
[09:52am] mst: jonbjornstad: if you use SUPER you are wrong
[09:52am] mst: jonbjornstad: fucking follow the example I give you
[09:52am] bwana147 left the chat room.
[09:52am] jonbjornstad: okie dokie.  will do.
[09:52am] mst: jonbjornstad: also, I used $new
[09:53am] mst: jonbjornstad: because generally in a method the invocant should be $class for a class method or $self for an object method
[09:53am] mst: jonbjornstad: in the case of a constructor I always use $new, to remind people that it's a constructor and it needs returning
[09:56am] jonbjornstad: i suspect most users (like me) of DBIC use it as magic.    understanding the fullness of its structure is not an easy task and should not be necessary.

[09:57am] rjbs: purl: thanks
[09:57am] mst: jonbjornstad: there was no understanding structure involved in what I just showed you
[09:57am] mst: jonbjornstad: only reading the docs, and trivial subclassing
[09:58am] jonbjornstad: okay.  thank you very much.

[10:13am] • Caelum liked OS/2
[10:13am] Caelum: wonder if it works in vmware
[10:13am] rjbs: I seem to recall liking it for a few weeks before discovering Linux.
[10:14am] rjbs: No, that can't be true.
[10:14am] rjbs: because OS/2 2 came out in 1992
[10:14am] rjbs: and I moved to Linux in 1995
[10:15am] rjbs: At the launch of OS/2 Warp in 1994, Patrick Stewart was to be the Master of Ceremonies; however Kate Mulgrew of the then-upcoming series Star Trek: Voyager was substituted at the last minute.
