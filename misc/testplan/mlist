        - Identical first/last names.
        - Unpartnered people with addresses that are 'numerically' close.
            e.g.
                123 Orange St Tampa, FL 12341
            and

            goes in a file - which you can save or view
            with normal browser actions.
    Change "Number of Records" to something less than the count.
        ReRun.   This is a random sample of the prior listing's rows.

        Now the listing is restricted to people who
        have at least one of the affiliations in their record.
        Add one of the affiliations to a person not in the
            report and verify they get into the rerunning of the report.
