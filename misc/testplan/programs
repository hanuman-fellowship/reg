Programs and Rentals

This is a large subject with many subplots.

Programs can only be seen by users with a role
of Program Staff or Program Admin.

A program has many attributes.

Name
Start date
End date
Title
Subtitle
Description
Cancellation Policy
Housing Cost
etc.

Some are required, some default automatically.

The start date must be before the end date (unless,
that is, the program name is "personal retreats" in
which case both should be blank).

Footnotes can only contain *, % and +.

To add a Leader and an Affiliation to a program
you choose "Update" when viewing the program not
when editing it.  You can choose as many leaders
and affiliations as you please.

At this point in development the main goal is to
create programs and to generate their web pages.
This takes a good bit of doing.

These categories of information are subsidiary to Programs:

Leaders
Cancellation Policies
Housing Costs
Templates
Exceptions
Strings
Rentals in a way, too.

Leaders are created by first finding/adding them as a Person.
Then you can say "Make Leader" and fill in the Leader attributes.
No leader attribute is required.
You can optionally upload a picture of the leader.
It will be resized for you so don't worry about it.
There _will_ be a small and a large version so please
upload a big enough image.  The widths of the two
sizes are controlled by a String.  These comments about
images apply to a Program, too.
After creation of a leader you can go back and forth
between "Leader Info" and "Person Info".  

Cancellation Policies must have one named "Default".
It is the normal policy that programs will have.
A cancellation policy is essentially just a bit of
explanatory text with a name.

Housing Costs must have one named "Default".
It is the normal lodging costs for a program.
There are 13 types of housing with a cost for each.
The cost fields must be either blank or a number.

Templates are complex pieces of HTML that have 'tags'
within them.  The role of Web Designer is the only one
that can see and modify these templates.  Note that
certain templates cannot be deleted.  These template names
are needed by reg.  The others can be selected when creating
a program.  Certain programs (like AVI or OGS) will
have their own template.  The default template is named
"template".

Exceptions can only be seen/created by the role
of Web Designer.   An exception is a Program name,
a tag name (selected from a fixed list), and
a value.   When filling tags in a template for a given
program you can make an exception and supply the value.
This is not needed often but it is nice to have.

Strings - this is a fixed list of key - value pairs.
This supplies various explanatory labels on the web
pages and also various configuration values.   Only
the web designer role can see/modify these.
A character of a double quote " is not allowed in these
strings.  If you need this (for some strange reason)
put %22 instead.  It is translated to a " for you.

Rentals are another type of program.  But simpler.
No image but a telephone number and an email address.
Like programs the start date must be before the end date.

= Sidenote: For all date fields (programs, rentals, members)
= you can enter the date November 8, 2009 in a variety of ways:
=
= 11/08/09
= 11-8-9
= 20091108
= 
= For today just enter 't'.
= For the 5th of the current month just '5'.
= For November 8th in the current year just '11 8' or '11/8'.

= Sidenote:  In the web descriptions of programs and rentals
= and in the leader biographies you can use these shortcuts
for various formatting, links, and lists:

This is *very* important and _fun_.

After all this information is in place you
can choose "Publish" and the web pages for the programs
will be generated.  This "Publish" link appears
in several places for convenience.
The response to "Publish" includes a link to
also publish the pictures - as needed when they
have changed.   On this response page there is
also a link to see the generated and published
web pages.   Examine each page _carefully_ to verify
all the information on it.  Be especially attentive
to the costs and cancellation policies.
There are two links: programs and events.
The events page includes the rentals, the programs
link does not.

Note that it is only the FUTURE programs and rentals 
that are published.  AND only those programs that are 'Web Ready'
and those rentals that are 'Linked'.

Furthermore programs that are not 'Linked' are published
in a separate place - named ul_ followed by the first
3 letters from the program name followed by the month
and day.  Like this:

    ul_OGS-11-8.html

At this point you will need to go to find these programs separately.
