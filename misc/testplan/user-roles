Users and Roles

The super admin role is the only one
that can create and modify users and assign
roles to them.  

Passwords must be >= 5 chars.
What other restrictions on passwords would be
indicated?   Users can change their own password
with the "Change Password" link.

New roles cannot be created even by the super admin.
Only Sahadev.  The super admin _can_ see all
the roles and the users that have those roles.

Some roles imply others.  A program admin
is automatically a program staff as well.
A super admin is all roles.
A member admin is also a mailing list staff.
