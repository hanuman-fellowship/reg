General Testing Guidelines

In the various categories (People, Reports, Programs, etc)
there are create, edit and delete functions.  Try each of these
in each category.

There are many variations on how
the information is presented.  For example, with People
you need to do a search to see them.  In Affiliations and Programs
all are presented in a long list.  In Affiliations you
have Edit and Delete links in the list.  In Programs
you must first view the program before you can edit it.

Required fields are marked with an asterisk.
Verify in each case that you do get an error message
if one is not given.

Errors arise for other reasons as well.  For example:

    - Program and Rental start/end dates
        in invalid format or with end < start.
    - invalid email addresses for people, leaders, rentals
    - non-numeric values for tuition, extra days, etc
    - invalid US state abbreviation
    - program footnotes can only contain *, % or +.

etc.  Try to break things and get all the error messages.
