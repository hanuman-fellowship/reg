How to set up a Reg developer environment.

- get a mac book pro
- get git
    the git installed by default on osx is dependent on xcode tools
        which we do not need so ...
    download the latest from: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
    you will have 'git-2.15.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg'
        or later
    install it
        maybe alias git to /usr/local/bin/git
- get permission to access the repository on bitbucket.org
- % cd
  % mkdir Reg
  % cd Reg
  % git clone git@bitbucket.org:sahadev108/reg.git
    this will download all of the Reg source
- get the Perl and sqlite2 environment that Reg uses
    a big tarfile
    it is not the latest and greatest and most current
        by any means but it works and has worked for 10 years.
- initialize the database
    % cd ~/Reg
    % ./db_init
