How to set up a Reg developer environment.

- get a mac book pro
- get git
    the git installed by default on osx is dependent on xcode tools
        which we do not need so ...
    download the latest from: https://git-scm.com/downloads 
    you will have 'git-2.15.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg'
        or later
    install it
        maybe alias git to /usr/local/bin/git
- get permission to access the repository on bitbucket.org
    do a ssh-keygen to make your id_rsa and id_dsa private and public keys
    have someone put your public key on bitbucket.org
        Click your avatar in the lower left
        Choose 'Bitbucket settings'
        Choose 'SSH keys'
        Choose 'Add key'
            and copy/paste it in there
- % cd
  % mkdir Reg
  % cd Reg
  % git clone git@bitbucket.org:sahadev108/reg.git
    this will download all of the Reg source
    why the extra level of directories with 'reg'??
- get the Perl and sqlite3 and ImageMagick environment that Reg uses
    a big tarfile - yes, big, but what's wrong with big?
    it is not the latest and greatest and most current
        by any means but it does work.
    if all the right files are in all the right places
        it will work - and it has worked for 10 years!
    cd; tar cvf /tmp/dev.tar /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/ 
    then move it over to the new machine
    cd;
    tar xvf dev.tar
    then set $PATH and the ENV
- initialize the database
    % cd ~/Reg
    % ./db_init
