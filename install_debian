# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.8.122
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.8.0
broadcast 192.168.8.255
gateway 192.168.8.1

maybe you change 192.168.8 to the first 3 octets
of what you have in your network (do ifconfig and look at en0)
change the 122 to two more than the 4th octet

the ifconfig/en0 ip address keeps changing depending on
what network you're connected to...

ideally one should not have to be connected to
the global net in order to do this development...

reboot and you're good to go
