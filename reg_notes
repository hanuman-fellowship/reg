People to help:
    Devendra
    Shantam
    Achyuta
    Sean Lazar
    Luke 
    John
    Shankar
    Temple people
    Other HFS people
Shantam tried to gather a team
    to support Scheduler, Reservations
        the group suggested other commercial projects
        would Ticketmaster/Eventbrite work?
        other management scheduler?:
    Is MMC really that unique?
    Are Prabha and Mohan also worried about
    Shantam's software support?

Today we all are so dependent on computer technology
    it is expected to be easy
And therefore we are dependent on those who
can wrangle that technology
ALWAYS something more and new to do
Brajesh in 90s - Jayant Gitomer 2 brochures a year
    snail mailed, fill out form, send in a check for
    deposit, registrar enters manually into reg.
    No credit cards.

11/28 conversation with Savita
Changes to reg1.tt2 and reg1 and reg2

no center tent verbiage
no "and include x nights lodging and all meals".

More text above housing table - from Savita at some point.

If Program doesn't allow strangers in double
then if someone chooses Double they must
have a shared person as well - otherwise ERROR
and explain it.

MMC does reg, Day Retreat - shift to left on edit

----GRID to akash................
keep checking new grid activity
    and call script/impgrid.pl with the code as parameter
        that script on akash/script is temporary
            no need to put in git

In Rental.pm
grid_emails
grid
badges
redirect on mountmadonna.org to akash
update grid url in arrangements (new and old plus preface)
String grid_url gets put in the above - ok
grab_new - sub check_grid
    can remove it
Web Grid, Web Grid no email links in view.tt2
rental/view.tt2 - grid_url from String
ensure grid_ne is link not separate file
grid.tt2 - akash not akash2
get_grid_file - gone

ftp_* strings can be obsoleted at some point
    called in script/finance_summary - a Listing > Finance
    called in script/packet48 - not in reg_cron any more
    in Rental.pm - delete booking, cancel cluster
        they check if room is occupied
mass_delete - okay

TO PUT IN PLACE:
    remove the grid backup from reg_cron
        and apply it
    check grid updates and do sc/impgrid.pl ...
    search for akash2 with sc/gr
    git commit all
    git pull on akash
    restart akash
    String for grid_url - www => akash
    redirect script on mmc.org
        grid => grid.old
        grid2 => grid
        git both add to repo
        git push, web
    notify future rental coordinators?
        cc Savita, Lara
        only Somatic, Fragrance?
        or all 8 with arrangements sent?
        arrangement_sent and new_contracts have the url.
            not old contracts (3 of the 8) 
        contract received not entered... only 3 of future
            deposit received does not imply contract received
            several still tenative?
