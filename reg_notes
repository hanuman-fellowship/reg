Yasodhara - RG, Reg?
People to help:
    Devendra
    Shantam
    Achyuta
    Sean Lazar
    Luke 
    John
    Shankar
    Temple people
    Other HFS people
Shantam tried to gather a team
    to support Scheduler, Reservations
        the group suggested other commercial projects
        would Ticketmaster/Eventbrite work?
        other management scheduler?:
    Is MMC really that unique?
    Are Prabha and Mohan also worried about
    Shantam's software support?

Today we all are so dependent on computer technology
    it is expected to be easy
And therefore we are dependent on those who
can wrangle that technology
ALWAYS something more and new to do

    snail mailed, fill out form, send in a check for
    deposit, registrar enters manually into reg.

11/28 conversation with Savita
Changes to reg1.tt2 and reg1 and reg2

no center tent verbiage
no "and include x nights lodging and all meals".

More text above housing table - from Savita at some point.

If Program doesn't allow strangers in double
then if someone chooses Double they must
have a shared person as well - otherwise ERROR
and explain it.

MMC does reg, Day Retreat - shift to left on edit

----GRID to akash................
keep checking new grid activity
    and call script/impgrid.pl with the code as parameter
        that script on akash/script is temporary
            no need to put in git
In Rental.pm
grid_emails2
grid2
badges2
    it calls get_badge_data_from_rental2 in lib/Badge.pm
redirect on mountmadonna.org to akash
update grid url in arrangements (new and old plus preface)
String grid_url gets put in the above
grab_new - sub check_grid
    can remove it
Web Grid, Web Grid no email links in view.tt2
rental/view.tt2 - grid_url from String
no need for 'Send to Web'
ensure grid_ne is link not separate file
TODO: functionality from check_grid from grab_new put into cgi-bin/grid
    including adding activity message
grid.tt2 - akash not akash2
grid_stale in Rental db is now obsolete
    remove references in db/Rental.pm and C/Rental.pm
    and trent/view.tt2

Program Tally
    why some payments have 'deposit' in what' - Lasater
        still a non-zero total in tally
    the Cancelled tally should not be zero both 3HO and Lasater
        3HO cancelled money total is    1480 - should be 0
