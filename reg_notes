Shantam tried to gather a team
    to support Scheduler, Reservations
        the group suggested other commercial projects
        would Ticketmaster/Eventbrite work?
        other management scheduler?:
    Is MMC really that unique?
    Are Prabha and Mohan also worried about
    Shantam's software support?

Today we all are so dependent on computer technology
    it is expected to be easy
And therefore we are dependent on those who
can wrangle that technology
ALWAYS something more and new to do
