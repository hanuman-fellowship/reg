#
# This crontab file should be in place on both kali and newkali.
# (Is newkali actually vishnu in our DNS?)
# On kali do not have the $REG/INACTIVE file present.
# DO have it present on newkali.
#
# If kali dies, any user can go to Reg at http://newkali:3000/login.
# They should login and go to Configuration > Emergency Switch (at the bottom - not in
# alphabetical order) and confirm that kali had died.   This action will 
# remove the INACTIVE file in $REG (on newkali) and report how recently the
# database had been synched with kali.  At that point all users should go to
# newkali:3000 to login and use Reg.
#
# I guess the Configuration > Emergency Switch choice will not be offered if
# the INACTIVE file is not present.
#
# When kali is again available (likely after some trouble) we'll *manually*
# synch it with newkali and put the INACTIVE file back in $REG on newkali.
# Then users will login to kali once again.
