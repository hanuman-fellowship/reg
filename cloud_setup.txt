    installing gcc, make, on cloudkali (ubuntu)
        Catalyst::RunTime, Catalyst::Devel
            some error at the end
            did it twice and then it took
        DBIx::Class
        Template came with Catalyst
        installed Catalyst::Manual separately
        apt-get install sqlite3
            tested sqlite3
        apt-get install mysql-server 
            root password is 'SitaRam'
            then:  /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
                no remote root login (only from localhost)
                no anonymous users
                left test database intact - but it is gone
            mysql -u root -p 
                entered password
                then 
                    show databases;
                    create database test;
                    create table person;
                    ...
                    drop ...
        installed YAML
        trying to install DBD::mysql
            some issue - with mysql_config?
            instead: apt-get install libdbd-mysql-perl
        installed DBD::SQLite
        cpan GD
            need apt-get install pkg-config
            apt-get install libgd-devel
            then cpan GD
                lots of stuff!!! jeez

    initialization of cloudkali
        added user sahadev - no password - ssh passphraseless
        actually, the password is '49deV#'
            sudo privileges
        what about for ftp'ing files?
    git clone'd reg software
    one more line for testing
    got mysql schema in place on cloudkali
    check_doc tweaks
    backed up rc.20.gz and grid.Wed.gz to lp - send_lp in backup/ on kali
        how to supply password?
        how did Shantam copy scheduler data to cloudkali?
    now I need to make a db_init!

    cpan Mail::Sender => Email::Sender
        no easy way to uninstall Mail::Sender
        so no problem
    cpan Image::Size
    made script/try and it succeeded to insert values into table string
        yay!
    installed my bash alias tools
    transfering files TO cloudkali:
        sftp sahadev@ec2-13-57-186-109.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
        scp fname sahadev@ec2-13-57-186-109.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:reg/xxx

    now, after a freshly initialized database schema,
        am inserting values for strings and roles
        next: houses and affiliations
        next: clusters
        next: users (with roles)
        then: people (with partners and affiliations)
    now clusters are ordered by cl_order - you can control
        needs a restart after that, though
        maybe reinitialize @clusters in Global?
            sure
Dec 22 10:30-11:30, 1:15-4:30
    continuing with cloudkali
    tried launching script/retreatcenter_server.pl
        failed - saying something about loading ...HTTP
            is not supported in this version of Catalyst
        we'll need to branch
        time to follow the tutorial
            I think this is the best way to start with the new version.
        We can get it working and then adapt Reg.
    cpan Task::Catalyst::Tutorial
        lots of things! :( :)
        failed.  try again.  worked.  :)
    set the timezone on the machine in my .profile
        export TZ='America/Los_Angeles'
    failed to get to port 3000
    talked with Shantam
    I'll use 80 for now running as root.

    templates and dispatch works as before - great
    I added INTERPOLATE => 1 to View/HTML.pm
    HTML is the default view - can name it something else 
        TT is what we called it in old Reg

    This IS quite involved.   But familiar.
    I'm not sure yet of how to move over...

    adding needed modules to Makefile.PL
        requires ....
        good idea

    as usual, one doesn't need to understand ALL the options;
        just the ones you need to get your app to work.

    cpan DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader
        automatically create the Model classes?
        lots of fancy lingua things
        failed several things - did a force
    cpan MooseX::NonMoose - needed to continue
    this may be an issue - can I use the existing
        model classes without modification?

    it analyzes the table structure and EACH TIME
        the server loads it generates the Model files.
        seems unnecessary?  Nice? Not sure.
    see:
        https://www.slideshare.net/davorg/database-programming-with-perl-and-dbixclass
    looks like it DOES detect many_to_many
        if I add them it complains

    experimented with a new script/rc_server.pl
        => will need new authentication modules
    need to do this development under a branch of master.
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519006/how-do-you-create-a-remote-git-branch
        this tracks it
Jan 7 10:15-1:45
    on to cloudkali and TRY IT
        following the authentication tutorial
            did some tweaking as directed
            if this works we'll never change it again!
        need to add 'requires' statements to Makefile.PL?????
        instead of Catalyst.check_user_roles
            the new way just uses c.check_user_roles.
        we used 'deny_access_unless' in RetreatCenter.pm
            to control access - will this eventually be covered in the
            up-to-date tutorial?
        tried rc_server.pl and it told me to:
        cpan install Spreadsheet::ParseExcel

        a few other tweaks - static => 'Plugin::Static::Simple'
        sudo and -p 80

        some problem with defining DBI connection info so...
        using retreatcenter.conf instead of retreatcenter.yml
        and removing authentication configuration from RetreatCenter.pm

        kept trying... commented out Global->init and DID
            get the login form.   Yay.
        but failed: do we have a connection to the database??
        let's see... nope
        hacking here and there - no luck
        may need to follow the tutorial with a test app on the Model etc
        it's close!
        it does redirect properly when I try member/list

        will need to move from Mail::Sender to Email::Sender
            it IS installed already

        Tried -Debug and StackTrace
        it led me to tweak the .config file with Model::RetreatCenterDB
            instead of Model::DB
        and voila!   it almost works.
        some issue with searches in Rides - obsolete?
        and something with Configuration
        
        but Wow!   almost there.

        configuration/index in lib/src/layout
        Ride.pm [ ] => { }  but obsolete... I'm confused here...

        no super_admin role so - edit it in $C/Login.pm
Jan 14 9:00-10:15
    messing around with cloudkali branches
    asking a question on IRC about companies using Catalyst
